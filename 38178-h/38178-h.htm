<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>When an author lays his book before the public, unless it be a work of
genius, some account of his motives for so doing is generally expected.
As this is a work that pretends to nothing but authenticity, and to be a
plain relation of facts, I shall only premise, that, placed in a
situation which gave me an opportunity of being witness to most of the
principal transactions of the expedition under Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Grey</span>
and Sir <span class="smcap">John Jervis</span> in the West Indies, and having leisure and
inclination to minute down the occurrences as they presented themselves,
I venture to appear before the public with such humble pretensions
alone, as the result of that opportunity and leisure can give me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>
My original intention reached no further than to publish a few
views of some interesting subjects, which abound in the Caraibean
Islands; but I selected those only which were rendered most so by
particular events. Though I pretend not to the powers of an artist
(being self-taught), yet I beg leave to urge in excuse for that want of
spirit and picturesque effect which, I fear, is but <span
class="correction" title="The original text was 'to'.">too</span> apparent in
my drawings, that they are scrupulously exact, and accurately delineate
the subjects they profess to represent.</p>

<p>When I at first communicated my design of publishing a few drawings,
taken during the West India Expedition, many of my friends, and some of
the officers who served with me, knowing that I had kept a journal of
the transactions, desired me to add a short account of them to accompany
the engravings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>
To those, at all conversant with writing such accounts, it will
not appear strange, that, as I proceeded to retrace those events which
form the most prominent feature of my life, I found a pleasure in
recognising many a transaction that had almost faded from my memory, and
by degrees it increased under my hand, till it became of size sufficient
to form a volume, and I was enabled to lay it before the public in a
more respectable form than I at first intended. But, that I may not
appropriate to myself merit belonging to another, I take a pleasure in
avowing, that through the kindness of an officer, who, from his rank, is
not more conspicuous than respected by the general tenor of his conduct,
I have been favoured with the assistance of a journal by an ingenious
and active officer of his division, which has greatly contributed to the
embellishment of my work, by the communication of many local
circumstances, impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
for me otherwise to have been acquainted with. The like assistance I
have also to acknowledge from a friend who served under General Prescott
during his gallant defence of Fort Matilda.</p>

<p>By the favour and indulgence of the Commander in Chief, I have been
permitted to make extracts from the public order-book of the army; these
form a large appendix, which, I trust, will not only confirm the
accuracy of my narration, but will prove both useful and entertaining to
the army in general.</p>

<p>Such has been the origin and progress of this publication; to the
candour, therefore, of the public I commit myself, trusting that, as my
ambition has been humble, I shall not be exposed to the severity of
literary criticism for not having obtained that which I have never
attempted.</p>

<h2>EXPEDITION AGAINST THE <i>FRENCH WEST INDIA ISLANDS</i>.</h2>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="small blockquot">EXPEDITION TO THE WEST INDIES DETERMINED ON
&hellip; SIR CHARLES GREY AND SIR JOHN JERVIS APPOINTED COMMANDERS IN
CHIEF &hellip; THE BOYNE SAILS FROM SPITHEAD &hellip; OCCURRENCES ON THE
VOYAGE FROM THENCE TO CARLISLE BAY, BARBADOES.</p>

<p>In the latter end of the year 1793, his Majesty having determined to
send a formidable armament to the West Indies, to reduce the French
islands in that quarter, and to secure his own from any attack of the
enemy, Lieutenant General Sir Charles Grey, Knight of the Bath, was
promoted to the rank of General in America, and Commander in Chief in
the West Indies. Several officers of distinguished abilities were also
appointed to act under him; and Vice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Admiral Sir John Jervis, Knight of the Bath, was nominated Commander in
Chief of the naval force on the same expedition.</p>

<p>After much delay, occasioned by nearly half the original force being
withdrawn from the armament intended for the West Indies, and applied to
another purpose, on the 24th of November, 1793, the Boyne of 98 guns,
Captain Grey commander, having Vice Admiral Sir John Jervis's flag
flying at the fore-topmast head, made the signal for sailing to the
fleet destined with her for this expedition, and dropped down to St.
Helen's, where she lay at single anchor, waiting for those ships that
were not ready; the ordnance storeships were particularly tardy. This
morning an unfortunate accident befel Mr. Scott, second lieutenant of
the Boyne, whose arm was broken by a block giving way in the fore part
of the ship, where he was stationed; but happily, by the care and skill
of Mr. Weir the surgeon, he was nearly recovered by the time the ship
reached Barbadoes.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the 26th of November the Boyne weighed anchor, and with the
rest of the fleet sailed from St. Helen's with a fair wind down channel.
On the 27th we lay to off Portland Road, waiting for the Quebec frigate,
which remained at Spithead to hasten the storeships and transports (that
were not at first ready to sail with the Boyne), and to convoy them
through the Needles.</p>

<p>On the 28th of November, in the morning, we were off the
Land's End, and were soon afterwards becalmed for a short time.
In the evening, a fresh breeze springing up, we proceeded on our
voyage. Before it was dark eight sail were seen from the mast head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
On the 29th we passed Commodore Paisley in the Bellerophon, with several
frigates in company. The Commodore saluted the Admiral's flag with
thirteen guns, which was returned from the Boyne with eleven guns.</p>

<p>As it may be proper to inform the reader that, in consequence of a
particular invitation from the Admiral, the Commander in Chief and his
suite, with several of the officers on the staff under him, were
passengers in the Boyne, I shall here subjoin their names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Thus, by the friendly intercourse subsisting between the two Commanders
in Chief, the time on the passage was most usefully employed in forming
plans of operation, which could not have been executed with that
promptness that distinguished the ensuing campaign, had it been
otherwise.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the 3d of December, the Rose frigate, Captain Riou, parted
company; as did, on the 7th following, Commodore Thompson and part of
the convoy, and we proceeded with the greater dispatch on our voyage.</p>

<p>On the 8th of December the wind proved foul, with rain and hazy weather.
At night, in the middle watch, we were attacked by a squall of wind and
rain, accompanied by a heavy sea, which struck the rudder with such
violence, that the men at the wheel losing their hold, were thrown down;
and the tiller breaking loose, stove in the gunner's cabin; at the same
time the pinnace, a six-oared boat, that was suspended over the stern,
was washed away, and totally lost.</p>

<p>On the 9th of December in the morning, the ship was taken aback by a
sudden squall of wind, attended with thunder and lightning, with a most
tremendous sea; we then wore ship, and stood to the south west. Those
who have never sailed in a ship of war of the first or second rate, can
form no idea of the grandeur and awfulness of the scene when so large a
body is struggling with contending elements. As the ship rolls through
the high swell her sides appear to twist and bend in a surprising
manner. The guns hanging on one side, and pressing against the other,
seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
as if, at every roll, they would, by their immense weight, force
their way through; which, added to the cracking of the cordage,
the roaring of the wind, and a variety of other noises, forms a
scene of surprise and alarm to the inexperienced voyager.</p>

<p>This squally weather continued at intervals for four days. On the 12th
we saw some sea gulls. On the 13th two strange sail hove in sight; the
Ulysses chased one of them, and we made sail after the other, and fired
several shot at her to bring her to; but in the evening were obliged to
give up the pursuit, for fear of parting from our convoy, which however
happened in the following night, during a heavy gale of wind.</p>

<p>On Saturday the 14th we saw a gull, and several turtle passed near the
ship.</p>

<p>On the 16th land was discovered at four P. M. supposed to be the island
of Porto Santo. All this day we sailed at the rate of seven and eight
knots an hour. Tuesday the 17th of December we found that during the
night we had passed by the island of Madeira; but this morning tacked
and stood towards it, and arrived off Funchial, the capital of that
island, of which we had a delightful view. As we approached the land the
surrounding country had a very beautiful appearance, especially after a
long voyage, when the eye has been wearied by the uninteresting sameness
of an extended ocean. The town of Funchial, so named from the Portuguese
word funcho, fennel, which grows in great abundance on the neighbouring
rocks, is situated at the bottom of a bay, and is a large ill-built
town: it has many churches and convents; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
as we did not go on shore, I can give no particular description of them.
Immediately behind the town the hills rise gradually one above the
other, terminating in prodigious high mountains, which are plentifully
covered almost half-way up with plantations of vines, interspersed with
churches and elegant houses. High up in the mountains, in a valley is
seen a convent, which we were informed is dedicated to our Lady of the
Mountain. All the buildings being white, formed very conspicuous, and
not unpleasing objects in the landscape. The mountains in this island
are very high. Pico Ruevo is supposed to be from its base near a mile in
perpendicular height, much higher than any land in England or Wales. The
sides of all the hills are well covered to a certain height with vines,
above which, to a vast extent, are woods of pine, chesnut, and a variety
of other trees unknown to Europe. The principal refreshments to be
procured here are wine, water, and onions; the latter are the finest in
the world, and in great plenty.</p>

<p>It being the Admiral's determination to lose no time, we only lay-to off
Funchial, till the wine intended for the use of the officers and ship's
company was taken on board; and it being the birth day of the Queen of
Portugal, we saluted the fort in honour of the day with twenty-one guns,
which was returned with an equal number. In the evening we made sail for
our destination; and fortunately from this time had a fair wind till we
got into the trades. On the 24th we passed the tropic of Cancer, lat. at
noon 23. 21. N. long. 32. W. The usual ceremony was observed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the crew (having first obtained the Captain's permission): a grotesque
Neptune and Amphitrité were drawn by their attendants on the
quarter-deck, where, after a solemn ditty chaunted by his aquatic
majesty, the usual collections were made, which, from the munificence of
the General and his friends, together with the contributions of those
officers of the ship who had never crossed the tropic before, amounted
to a sum sufficient to supply the ship's company with plenty of
vegetables on their arrival at Barbadoes.</p>

<p>The 25th of December, being Christmas day, divine service was performed
on the quarter-deck by the Chaplain, the crew appearing as on a Sunday,
in clean trowsers and jackets: and here I must beg leave to mention,
that I never saw more regularity and decorum in any place of worship
than is invariably observed on board of his Majesty's ships of war.</p>

<p>This day we passed an American brig; and the weather being fair,
Lieutenant Bowen and Captain Mason went on board her. She was from
Cadiz, and reported, that yesterday she passed a Spanish man of war
bound for Europe.</p>

<p>On the 26th of December we saw several albicores, dolphins, and grampus,
and shoals of flying fish; lat. at noon 22. 10. N. long. 34. 46. W.</p>

<p>On the 29th of December, being Sunday, and the weather fair, divine
service was performed as usual.</p>

<p>The heat of the climate now began to be troublesome to those who had
been unaccustomed to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
On Monday the 6th of January, 1794, land was discovered from the
mast-head, which proved to be the island of Barbadoes; and by noon the
Boyne anchored in Carlisle Bay<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="small blockquot">THE COMMANDERS IN CHIEF PREPARE FOR THE
EXPEDITION AGAINST MARTINIQUE &hellip; GUN-BOATS CONSTRUCTED, AND
DESCRIBED &hellip; A SHORT ACCOUNT OF BARBADOES &hellip; SALE OF SLAVES
&hellip; A LIST OF THE FLEET.</p>

<p>The first news we received on our arrival at Barbadoes was, that the
yellow fever had, in the course of last year, carried off fifty-eight
officers of the army in this and the neighbouring islands, and privates
in proportion. It proved fatal to great numbers of the inhabitants also
of Barbadoes; from fifteen to twenty whites died daily in the town of
Bridgetown, and about half that number of blacks and people of colour.
We were at the same time comforted with an assurance that the disease
had entirely subsided; but the reader will soon see how fallacious were
our hopes in this respect. Alas! too many families have to lament the
fatal effects of this dreadful disorder; and the kingdom at large may
attribute to it the losses we afterwards sustained, rather than to any
other cause. But of this more hereafter.</p>

<p>His Excellency Sir Charles Grey landed at Bridgetown on the 7th of
January, and resided at a house called the Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
House, on Constitution Hill, a healthy situation, about half a mile out
of town, where he was busily employed during his residence on the island
in concerting plans for future operations, in reviewing the troops, and
providing against those exigencies which in an enemy's country an army
must be exposed to. A report was here circulated that General Rochambeau
the commanding officer at Martinique, and Bellegarde the popular leader
of the people of colour, were at variance; but this news by no means
caused the least relaxation on the part of our commanders, who continued
their preparations with as much ardour as before; and it is well they
did so, as we afterwards found the enemy on their guard, and prepared to
resist us with their united force.</p>

<p>The Admiral in the mean time was equally employed in preparing every
thing in his department, and for that purpose remained on board (a
conduct he invariably followed), by which every thing was carried on
under his own inspection, and delay (the consequence of neglect) was
thus prevented.&mdash;On our voyage, whenever the weather permitted, a
certain number of seamen were exercised, and formed into companies, to
be commanded by lieutenants of the navy, with the rank of captains on
shore. While in Carlisle Bay these seamen were again exercised, and
instructed in the use of small arms and pikes. This plan of training the
seamen for more duty was highly beneficial on this expedition, as will
hereafter appear.</p>

<p>Every exertion was now made both by sea and land. The gun-boats, which
were constructed in England, then taken to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
pieces, and brought to the West Indies in storeships, were put together
with as much speed as possible; yet, from the nature of their structure,
could not be finished until a day or two before we sailed. There were
six gun-boats, each carrying a twenty-four pounder in the bow, which
moved backwards and forwards on a groove: round the whole on the
gun-whale was a moveable barricade or breast-work, composed of several
folds of bulls' hides, nailed to some boards of an inch thick in
partitions, and capable of turning a musket ball. Each boat had two
masts; the foremast inclined forward (to give more room for the gun to
recoil), and had a latine sail and jib: the mizen was a lug-sail.
Sweeps, or large oars, were also supplied, to be used when there was no
wind, or when becalmed by the high lands near the shore. Each of these
vessels was at first commanded by a midshipman, who, as his conduct
merited, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>In the mean time the troops were landed from the transports, the sick
comfortably lodged in the hospitals, and every attention paid, to render
the service complete. As the major part of our army consisted of the
flank companies, great pains were taken by the commanding officers to
train them for the most active service: the light infantry were
exercised daily by Major General Dundas, who had, in America and on the
continent, distinguished himself at the head of that battalion.
Particular attention was paid to instruct the army in the absolute
necessity of strict obedience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to orders; for which purpose the Commander in Chief published in the
general orders to the army such full and comprehensive instructions, as
to preclude the necessity of multiplying them in future, and to take
away the possibility of any one pleading ignorance of them<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Before we quit this island, it may be agreeable to the reader to have
some account of it, and of the general appearance of the country.
Barbadoes is situated in 13. 10. N. lat. and 59. W. long. from London.
It is called one of the British Charaibé Islands, though at present none
of those ancient inhabitants remain on it. The island has a flat
appearance; but, from the variety of plantations, the beauty and
freshness of the verdure, and the numerous houses, mills, and other
buildings, scattered in great profusion, it presents a delightful
prospect to strangers on their approach to it after a long voyage. I
shall not pretend to give an history of the island, but must refer the
reader to the elegant work of Bryan Edwards, Esq. whose account of the
British West India Islands is written with every advantage to be derived
from local residence and connections, as well as from the indefatigable
attention and abilities of the author.</p>

<p>During our residence at this island curiosity led me to be present at a
sale of slaves, just imported from the coast of Africa. As this horrid
traffic in human flesh has been the topic of public investigation for
some time past, and much learning and ingenuity has been displayed on
both sides of the question, I shall not give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
any opinion on it, but merely state facts that came within my own
knowledge. The sale is proclaimed by beat of drum, and is held (at
Barbadoes at least) not in the open air, as I had been taught to
believe, but in a commodious house appointed for that purpose. At the
time I am speaking of, there were about forty men, women, and children,
sitting on benches round a large room, with no other covering than a
cloth round their waists. Some of them were decorated with beads, given
to them by their captors, and bracelets round their wrists and ancles,
and were much tattooed on their faces and breasts, which I understood
from a seaman who came with them, was a mark of distinction in their own
country. I was also informed that they had buried one hundred and
forty-nine on the passage, having had a very bad and protracted voyage:
the crew had suffered equally, and had buried one third of their
original complement. As soon as the planter has fixed on a slave he
retires with him and the salesman to another room, there concludes the
bargain, and departs with his purchase to his plantation, where the
newcomer, being clothed in a coarse jacket, and provided with a hat,
knife, and other trifles, is placed with one of the old negroes, by whom
he is instructed in his business. In regard to the severity exercised by
the slave owners on their slaves, whatever may have been the case, I am
well assured that now there are seldom instances of those cruelties
which have been so feelingly described, at least in the islands we
visited on this expedition. At Barbadoes they appeared to be in as
comfortable a situation as the lower ranks of society generally are; and
as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
climate is peculiarly favourable to poverty (clothes and firing, the
great articles of expence to the poor in other countries, being here
hardly required), I may venture to affirm, that the slaves in the West
Indies are in a better situation, <i>as to the necessaries of life</i>, than
the labouring poor in England, or any other country in Europe. Far be it
from me, however, to justify slavery in itself; it most certainly is an
evil: but when a matter of great importance is in agitation, every
information should be obtained, and both sides of the question ought to
be strictly examined. Certainly the benevolent intentions of the friends
to the abolition of slavery in the West Indies have, by their exertions
in the cause of humanity, occasioned a more minute inquiry into the
situation of the slaves than had ever been made before; and several
excellent laws to regulate the treatment of that unfortunate class of
human beings have in consequence been passed in the different islands.
It is affirmed by many very humane people, that the entire abolition of
the traffic <i>itself</i> would not help the cause of humanity so much as was
at first contended (for I believe the former plan of immediately
emancipating those already imported, is allowed by all to be dangerous
in the extreme); and it is the opinion of many writers, that the greater
part of those Africans sold to our plantations would remain slaves in
their own country, or be put to death by their captors. If so, surely it
is better for them to be carried to a country where they have a chance
at least of better treatment, and where many of them are instructed in
their duty to their God, of which before they had no idea.</p>

<p>The land force employed on this expedition was as follows. A detachment
of white and a detachment of black light dragoons, three battalions of
grenadiers, three battalions of light infantry, the sixth, ninth,
fifteenth, thirty-ninth, forty-third, fifty-sixth, fifty-eighth,
sixty-fourth, sixty-fifth, and seventieth regiments, with detachments
from the second, twenty-first, and sixtieth regiments. The troops were
divided into three brigades; the first commanded by Lieutenant General
Prescott, the second by Major General Thomas Dundas, and the third by
Major General his Royal Highness Prince Edward (till whose arrival from
Canada the command of this brigade was given to Lieutenant Colonel
Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>

<p class="small blockquot">THE FLEET SAILS FROM BARBADOES &hellip;
ANCHORS ON THE SOUTH COAST OF MARTINIQUE &hellip; CAPTURE OF A BATTERY
&hellip; GENERAL GREY LANDS WITH HIS ARMY &hellip; FLAG OF TRUCE FIRED
ON BY THE ENEMY &hellip; THE COMMANDERS IN CHIEF ATTACK THE ISLAND AT
THREE DIFFERENT PLACES AT THE SAME TIME.</p>

<p>On Monday, Feb. 3, 1794, the fleet of men of war, transports,
storeships, &amp;c. sailed from Carlisle Bay, and the next morning land
was seen, which proved to be the island of St. Lucia, bearing west
several leagues. On Wednesday, Feb. 5, we approached the island of
Martinique on the south east coast, off the bay of Maran; two forts, one
at Pointe du Jardin, the other at Pointe de la Borgnesse, which defended
the entrance to that bay, began to fire on our ships as they approached;
notwithstanding which, the Boyne and the rest of the fleet anchored by
four P.M. not far from the battery on Pointe de la Borgnesse, Lieutenant
Bowen having previously run along shore in a small schooner to sound the
depth of water. Our troops were now preparing to land, and had filled
several flat-boats which lay along-side the men of war,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
when the battery opened a heavy fire on them, which was quickly answered
by the ships; the troops at the same time pushed in and landed, covered
by the gun-boats: seeing which, and alarmed by some well-directed shot
from the Boyne and Veteran, the enemy fled in disorder from the fort,
which our troops immediately entered, and having hoisted the British
colours, were saluted with three cheers from the fleet. A trench was
found in the battery, communicating with the magazine, in which a train
was laid, and a brand or match laid across it. Happily (by the exertions
of the officers and men) this dastardly plot was prevented taking
effect. The guns were immediately turned upon the enemy in their
retreat, and against the town of St. Anne; but as this was a post of no
great consequence, after they had spiked the guns and broke the
carriages, the troops reimbarked<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>In the evening the enemy in the battery on Pointe du Jardin burnt the
sugar plantations near them, as we suppose, out of revenge for our
success at Pointe de la Borgnesse; from the dryness of the canes the
fire spread with great rapidity, and did much damage. Near us was the
village of St. Luce, where a two-gun battery, directed by the curé of
St. Luce, seeming disposed to trouble us, the Veteran opened her lower
deckers on it, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
drove the enemy from thence<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.&mdash;On
Thursday morning, Feb. 6, our troops landed at Trois Rivieres, in the
bay of St. Luce, without opposition, to the number of two thousand four
hundred and eighty-four men, under the direction of Lieutenant General
Prescott. Sir Charles Grey and his suite then landed, and the whole army
moved off from the landing-place in two divisions; the first division
began to march about twelve at noon, the second division at five in the
afternoon. Lieutenant Rogers of the Boyne soon after landed at the
curé's battery at St. Luce, and found the two cannon there to be
twenty-four pounders, that had belonged to the Raisonable man of war,
wrecked some time since on this island. They destroyed these guns, and
returned on board without any loss. This evening a gun-boat and
flat-boat with seamen, under the command of Lieutenants Rutherford and
Ogle of the Boyne, and Mr. Johnson, midshipman, attempted to cut out
some vessels in the harbour near Maran, where they were much exposed
both to the great guns and musquetry of the enemy; but they succeeded so
far as to bring off two American schooners; two others saved themselves
by running ashore close under the guns of Fort St. Etienne.</p>

<p>On Feb. 7th the Admiral sent (with a flag of truce) Lieutenant Miln of
the Boyne, accompanied by Lieutenant James of the fifteenth regiment,
and the Chaplain of the Boyne, with a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
for the municipality or governor of Maran. As they approached the town
they perceived hostile preparations making in the fort of St. Etienne;
but, in hopes of preventing a flag of truce being insulted, Mr. Miln
boarded one of the American ships that had been run aground the day
before, intending, in case the captain of it was on board, to take him
in his company. Being now within half gun-shot of the fort, the enemy
began to fire on the boat, notwithstanding the flag of truce, and
continued to do so, although Mr. Miln endeavoured to proceed towards the
shore: but the enemy seeming determined to oppose his landing, and
several of their shot falling close by the boat, he at length judged it
most prudent to return. As he passed Pointe du Bourgnesse he perceived
some negroes near the fort, and sent the two gentlemen who accompanied
him armed, to endeavour to cut off their retreat, and to give them the
papers which were to have been delivered to the commander at Maran; but
the negroes, on perceiving them land, immediately made off towards the
town: they however found a wounded man, whose leg had been broken by a
cannon ball, with whom they left the papers, adding a note to express
their surprise and indignation at a flag of truce being fired on<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mr. Miln went with the gun-boats against Maran, to form
a diversion in favour of Lieutenants Rutherford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and Rogers, who had landed with two companies of seamen to carry fresh
provisions to Sir Charles Grey's army. This had the desired effect, as
soon after a large body of troops came down from the hills to the town
and fort, which might otherwise have fallen in with the seamen on their
march.</p>

<p>The next day, Feb. 8, the Admiral sent another flag of truce by the same
officer to the town of St. Anne. He took with him an American captain of
a ship, in addition to his former complement; and having been so roughly
handled the day before, he also ordered a gun-boat to attend. St. Anne's
was entirely deserted. The American then proceeded a mile up the country
to the house of a planter, who had left it; but finding his mulatto
mistress there, he left the papers with her, to forward to the
commanding officer at Maran. On this estate the American told us he saw
three hundred slaves, and every thing in perfect order; from whence we
judged the owner of it had been a friend to the revolution, the houses
and plantations of the royalists being universally destroyed. The enemy
now entirely evacuated this part of the country, to throw themselves
into Fort Bourbon; and in their retreat burnt several fine plantations,
and murdered many slaves of the royalists with circumstances of the most
horrid cruelty.</p>

<p>I should have mentioned that, on our approach to this island, the
Commanders in Chief dispatched General Dundas with Commodore Thompson to
the attack of Trinité, and another division under the command of Colonel
Sir Charles Gordon, assisted by Captain Rogers of the Quebec, to Case de
Navirre; while Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Charles Grey, assisted by Lieutenant General Prescott, and under cover
of the Boyne, &amp;c. made good his landing at Trois Rivieres: thus, by
making three attacks upon distant parts of the island at the same time,
the force and attention of the enemy was divided; and by that spirited
conduct, which animated all parties, more particularly by the unanimity
which prevailed between the army and navy, they all happily succeeded.
And here I must beg leave to observe, that where the commanders are
united in friendship, and equally inspired with an earnest desire to
serve their king and country, their example will always have such
influence on the conduct of those under their command, that the same
friendly intercourse will be sure to subsist between the subordinate
ranks of the two services; and, from the Commanders in Chief to the
private soldier and sailor, they will join hand and heart, and form a
phalanx that nothing can withstand.</p>

WHYTE DETACHED &hellip; TAKES PIGEON ISLAND &hellip; THE ADMIRAL ANCHORS
OFF PIGEON ISLAND &hellip; DESCRIPTION OF THE BAY OF FORT ROYAL &hellip;
THE THIRD BRIGADE LANDS AT CAS DE NAVIRES.</p>

<p>I have already said that his Excellency Sir Charles Grey, with
Lieutenant General Prescott, and that part of the army which landed at
Trois Rivieres, marched from thence on Feb. 6th across the country to La
Riviere Sallée, a distance of two leagues, over very mountainous roads,
and that evening they reached the town of the same name, situated on its
banks, where the troops were lodged. They met with no opposition on
their march, and lost only one man (a sergeant), who died of fatigue and
heat. On the march the Commander in Chief detached Brigadier General
Whyte, with the second battalion of light infantry commanded by
Lieutenant Colonel Close, with two amuzettes, to force the batteries of
Cape Solomon and Point a Burgos, in order to get possession of Pigeon
Island, as our shipping could not go into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
bay of Fort Royal till that was accomplished; nor indeed could our boats
with provisions and ammunition go with safety round to the army at
Riviere Sallée. On Feb. 7th General Whyte took two small pieces of
cannon loaded, at a village in the bay of d'Arlet (one hundred and fifty
mulattoes having fled at his approach); and immediately marching to the
attack of the two posts above mentioned of Point Solomon and Burgos, the
enemy surrendered at discretion, their retreat being cut off. In the
interim the Commander in Chief received intelligence of a body of the
enemy having crossed the bay from Fort Royal, and landed near Morne
Charlotte Pied, where they took post to intercept the communication
between General Whyte and head quarters at Sallée: on which he instantly
dispatched Adjutant-General Colonel Dundas, with the seventieth
regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Johnson, with two howitzers,
to dislodge them. This was executed that night with great spirit, and
the post taken possession of early the next morning, the enemy being
completely defeated at the first charge. In this action Captain Nares of
the seventieth regiment distinguished himself so as to gain the notice
of the Commander in Chief in public orders<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>Brigadier General Whyte (being now reinforced with a detachment of the
royal artillery, some ordnance, mortars, &amp;c.) Colonel Symes, with a
detachment of the fifteenth regiment and two hundred seamen from the
Admiral, armed with pikes and pistols, under the command of Lieutenants
Rogers and Rutherford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
ascended the heights on the 9th instant, and got possession of Mount
Matharine, which commanded Pigeon Island, at the distance of not more
than four hundred yards, where they erected their batteries. On this day
his Excellency the Admiral sailed from Maran Bay, and anchored in Petite
Ance d'Arlet, from whence he could send succours of men and ammunition
to General Whyte; who accordingly instantly landed two companies of
seamen, with several cannon, which they in vain attempted to drag over
the hills to General Whyte's post, a distance of four or five miles; for
the steepness and ruggedness of the roads, rendered every effort
ineffectual. However he sent him a plentiful supply of shot and other
ammunition, with one howitzer; and in the evening Lieutenant Miln was
dispatched with a party, carrying provisions and spirits for the army.
We found the country on the march from Ance d'Arlet to General Whyte's
camp beautiful in a high degree, but the roads almost impassable: a
succession of steep roads, through thick woods, at length brought us to
the summit of a hill (on which our seamen were posted), commanding a
fine view of the bay of Fort Royal, with Islet aux Ramieres, or Pigeon
Island, in front; and on each side rose hills finely clothed with wood,
on one of which our little army was posted. During the time we were
there, the enemy on Pigeon Island annoyed us with their shells and shot,
by which one of our seamen was killed, and another mortally wounded. The
two five and a half inch howitzers, brought by the seventieth regiment
from head quarters, being now placed in a battery under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
direction of Captain de Rivigne of the royal artillery, so as to take
the island in reverse, and Colonel Dornford having also joined with a
company of artificers, the batteries were completed during the night of
the 10th instant, and opened on Tuesday morning, February 11th, under
the conduct of Major Manley, who kept up so incessant and well-directed
a fire upon Pigeon Island, that in two hours the garrison struck their
colours, and surrendered at discretion, having fifteen killed and
twenty-five wounded. When our batteries opened, it consisted of two
hundred and three men.</p>

<p>After the strong orders the Commander in Chief issued during the time he
was preparing for the commencement of the campaign at Barbadoes, in
which, among other things, he declared his determination to punish with
the utmost severity any one who should presume to maraud or plunder the
inhabitants, it is surprising that on the first day's march any soldier
should have had the temerity to offend against that order: but we had a
melancholy instance of it in William Milton of the tenth light dragoons,
and Samuel Price of the black dragoons, who were tried and convicted of
a robbery in the house of Jacques, an inhabitant of Sallée; and the
General, being determined to put an early stop to such enormities, had
the sentence put in execution, and they were both hanged in view of the
whole army on February 8th<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>On the capture of Islet aux Ramieres, or Pigeon Island, the Admiral
sailed with the rest of his fleet from Ance d'Arlet on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Wednesday, Feb. 12th, and anchored in Fort Royal Bay, off Pigeon Island,
by which means he could co-operate with his colleague, and supply the
army with ammunition and provisions at pleasure. As the ships worked
into the bay, several shells were thrown at them from Fort Louis, but
happily without doing any mischief.&mdash;It is impossible to conceive a
more beautiful scene than presented itself on our entrance into this
fine bay. On the north side we saw Fort Louis and the town of Fort
Royal; and immediately behind it, on the top of a steep hill, was the
strong fortification of Fort Bourbon, which, with the tri-coloured flag
waving on its walls, formed a conspicuous object in the landscape; the
parapet being built of white stone, strongly contrasted with the vivid
glow of verdure on the surrounding hills. To the westward rose
majestically prodigious mountains, called Les Pitons du Carbet, the
hills on the side of which were cultivated, while the mountains
themselves were covered with wood to their summits. Eastward the bay
opens to several bays and harbours, into which some noble rivers
discharge themselves, and pleasant islands of different dimensions and
forms, embellish the whole. Pigeon Island, or Islet aux Ramieres, is
situated on the south side of the bay of Fort Royal, about two hundred
yards from the shore, and is a steep rock, inaccessible except on one
side by a ladder fixed against a perpendicular wall. The summit is about
thirty yards above the level of the sea, and is three hundred paces
round. It contained the following ordnance, viz. Eleven forty-two
pounders, six thirty-two pounders, four thirteen-inch mortars, and
one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
howitzer, with an immense quantity of stores and ammunition, and a large
stove to heat shot; it also had good barracks. It is famous for having
prevented Admiral Rodney with twelve sail of the line from entering the
bay in 1782.</p>

<p>On the 12th of February the fifteenth regiment, led by Major Lyon, and
commanded by Captain Paumier, surprised several hundreds of the enemy,
very strongly posted on the heights of le Grande Bouclain, killed
several of them, and took all their ammunition and arms, with their
cattle.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Sir Charles Gordon with the third brigade had landed on the 8th instant
to leeward, on the side of Cas de Navires, under cover of a division of
the fleet commanded by Captain Rogers in the Quebec<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.
The enemy being masters of the grand road and the heights above it, he
made a movement towards the mountains, and turning them (unperceived)
with part of his force, gained the most commanding post in that part of
the country. By day-break on the 9th instant Colonel Myers, descending
the heights, took possession of la Chapelle, and a post established by
the enemy above it; and on his return to the column, Sir Charles Gordon
proceeded through most difficult ground to the heights of Berne, above
Ance La Haye. The enemy, after having abandoned the battery of Cayman,
and set fire to the village, still keeping a constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
fire on him from the batteries of St. Catharine, he took a position
which gave him an easy communication with the transports; when on the
12th he observed the battery and works at St. Catharine, and the posts
which guarded the first ravine, abandoned by the enemy, on which he took
possession of them, while Colonel Myers, with five companies of
grenadiers and the forty-third regiment, crossed four ravines higher up,
seizing all the batteries that defended them. This movement was
completely successful, the enemy flying on every side, and our troops
were soon in possession of the five batteries between Cas de Navires and
Fort Royal. They then proceeded, and occupied the posts of Gentilly, La
Coste, and La Archet, within a league of Fort Bourbon.</p>

<p>When Commodore Thompson with his division (having on board Major General
Dundas and the second brigade) parted from the fleet on their voyage
from Barbadoes, he proceeded with the utmost expedition to the north
east part of the island; and on Feb. 5th arrived off the bay of Gallion.
Captain Faulknor in the Zebra led in, and placed himself along-side of
the battery on Point a Chaux, from whence he soon drove the enemy. The
Beaulieu, Captain Salisbury, and the Woolwich, Captain Parker, followed;
and the troops were landed without further opposition about a league
from the town of Trinité, which was situated on the further side of the
isthmus that formed the bay of Gallion. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
General Dundas halted for that night. Early the next morning he began
his march towards Trinité. As he moved off from the ground he had
occupied during the night, the enemy annoyed him much by a brisk fire of
musketry from the cane fields, where a large body of them were
concealed; from thence however they were soon driven by the bayonet,
which (as the Commander in Chief observed<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>)
in the hands of a gallant British soldier is the first of weapons. In
this business we had one artilleryman killed, and two officers and three
privates wounded. The General then continued his march to La Bruen, a
strong post situated on an eminence immediately over the town of
Trinité. The light infantry drove the enemy from this post after an
action of about fifteen minutes. We had two men killed and seven or
eight wounded, among which were two officers. The enemy's loss was much
greater. Early on the night of the 6th our troops took possession of
Fort Louis (and changed its name to Fort Dundas), and Fort Bellgarde, a
post that commanded the harbour of Trinité. Mons. Bellgarde, general of
the army composed of people of colour, finding that we had taken
possession of the forts, made a precipitate retreat towards the
mountains, having previously set fire to the town of Trinité, the best
part of which, together with a great quantity of stores of all kinds,
was consumed; but Commodore Thompson took possession of the vessels in
the harbour and road. In all these attacks the seamen (under command of
Captain Salisbury) bore a part, and by their intrepidity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and good conduct gained the esteem as well as applause of the army.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 7th General Dundas proceeded with his brigade to
the attack of Gros Morne, where he was informed General Bellgarde was
strongly posted in considerable force; but on his arrival he found the
forts evacuated. Gros Morne is a situation of great importance, being
strongly fortified, and commanding the principal pass between the
northern and southern parts of the island, and famous for being the
rendezvous of the democrats during the revolution, previous to our
arrival. Besides the principal fort, there is a redoubt on either side,
about a mile distant, commanding the road leading to the fort. A
detachment of the queen's regiment and a party of the marines being left
to garrison Trinité, under command of Major Skerret, and the battalion
of the 64th to garrison Le Gros Morne, the remainder of the brigade
marched early in the morning of the 9th instant, and on the evening of
the same day took possession of a strong situation called Bruno, where
there had formerly been a fort, some of the guns of which were still
remaining: it lies about two leagues north east of Fort Bourbon, and
from it our army could see the enemy in their out-posts from that
fort<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.
After the troops had halted for some time, Colonel Cradock with three
companies of the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
battalion of grenadiers was ordered to advance and take possession of
the post of Maltide, where a considerable number of the enemy were
assembled with their colours flying; but on his approach they evacuated
the place in haste. Of this post our troops had the quiet possession
that night, and all the next day; but in the night between the 10th and
11th they were attacked by a party of the enemy, commanded by Mons.
Bellgarde, amounting to about eight hundred men, who, having crept up
under cover of the canes and underwood, commenced a heavy fire on our
troops, who, though rather taken by surprise, charged the enemy in their
turn with such vigour and determined bravery, as forced them sorely to
repent their temerity, and retreat towards Fort Bourbon with
considerable loss. In this action Captain M'Ewen of the thirty-eighth
regiment and seven privates were killed, and nineteen wounded. Next day
a great quantity of fire arms were picked up, which the enemy had left
behind them in their precipitate retreat. In the evening of the 11th the
post was reinforced by three companies of grenadiers and part of the
second battalion of light infantry; but that night all was quiet. Early
on the morning of the 12th the grenadiers were ordered back to Bruno,
and the battalion of the sixth regiment, commanded by Major Scott, took
their place at Maltide, and the wounded were sent on board the hospital
ship.</p>

<p>As the bay and harbour of Fort Royal were now completely opened to our
shipping by the capture of Pigeon Island, the Commander in Chief moved
forward on the 14th from La Riviere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Sallée to Bruno with the remainder of the first brigade, a principal
part of which had, under General Prescott, reached that place the day
before; having previously concerted the attack of St. Pierré with
General Dundas, that general marched on the evening of the 13th from
Bruno with the second battalion of grenadiers, the thirty-third and
fortieth light companies, and the sixty-fifth regiment, to Gros Morne,
where he halted that night, and early on the 14th marched to Trinité;
from whence he dispatched a sloop with the packs and blankets of his
army round towards la Basse Pointe, in order to expedite his march
toward St. Pierre, the capital of the island, the capture of which was
now his object. From Gros Morne General Dundas had detached Colonel
Campbell through the woods by Bois le Buc with the second battalion of
light infantry and sixty-fifth regiment to Montigné. At five o'clock in
the evening of the 14th General Dundas marched from Trinité (being
joined by a company of the second or queen's regiment, commanded by the
Honourable Captain Ramsay): after marching all night he halted for three
hours; and soon after day-break on the morning of the 15th, having
passed the river Capot, arrived at the heights of Calbass, after a march
of thirty miles over a rough mountainous country. The fatigue of such a
march in a tropical climate can only be conceived by those who have
experienced it: harassed and worn down, it was necessary to give the
troops some rest before they attempted to ascend the steep and craggy
mountain, over the top of which was their road, commanded by a battery,
where the enemy appeared in great force,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
with their colours flying. The spirit of our soldiers however overcame
all difficulties, and they ascended the heights with such alacrity, that
the enemy, alarmed at their determined conduct, evacuated the fort
(fortunately for our men), without making any resistance; as, by the
time they reached the summit of the mountain, they were so exhausted,
that a steady opposition might have proved fatal to them. From hence
(the post having previously been destroyed by the enemy, who had broken
the guns and scattered the ammunition) General Dundas proceeded about
four miles further, to a place called Morne Rouge: here he halted, and
shortly after saw Colonel Campbell at Post au Pin, half a mile short of
Montigné, under a heavy fire from five or six hundred of the enemy,
strongly posted. General Dundas instantly pushed forward his advanced
guard, under command of the Hon. Captain Ramsay, who gained the summit
by extraordinary exertions, fired on the enemy, at that time engaged
with Colonel Campbell, and silenced their fire; and, when joined by the
second battalion of grenadiers, took possession of Montigné, where he
was reinforced by two companies of grenadiers. The major general took
post himself on Morne Rouge, and visiting Colonel Campbell's column,
found he had been attacked at half past nine o'clock in the morning, and
the enemy being within twenty yards of the fortieth light company, at
the head of which he was, had charged them with bayonets, when, to the
great grief of the whole army, he fell by a ball through his head from
the musket of a mulatto, who had concealed himself behind a bush till
the Colonel came close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
up to it. Colonel Campbell was a man high in estimation as a military
character, and no less respected for his private worth, being sincere in
his friendships and steady in his attachments. When General Dundas
arrived at Morne Rouge, the enemy were on their march to re-attack our
troops; but the appearance of our grenadiers so near them, caused them
to relinquish their plan at that time: but in the evening of the same
day the General observed bodies of the enemy moving towards his front at
Morne Rouge, and forming under a small redoubt near that post. The
thirty-third, thirty-fourth, and forty-fourth companies of grenadiers,
with a field piece, and Captain Whitworth of the artillery (the whole
under the command of Major Forbes), were ordered to advance, when a
smart engagement commenced. The enemy were covered by a brisk fire from
two field pieces on Morne Bellvieu, a strongly situated battery
immediately in their rear. The action continued for about half an hour,
when the enemy gave way, and during the night abandoned the fort,
leaving two field pieces behind them. From the number of graves observed
the following day (corroborated by the accounts of some prisoners),
their loss must have been considerable; ours consisted of one officer
(Lieutenant Keating of the thirty-third regiment) and two privates
wounded, and one private killed.&mdash;At two o'clock the following
morning the sixteenth, thirty-fifth, and fifty-fifth companies of
grenadiers were ordered to advance and storm the battery upon Morne
Bellvieu, and were to be supported (if necessary) by the ninth and
sixty-fifth companies. All their flints were taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
out, the bayonet alone to be the soldier's defence. However, the enemy
had been so roughly handled the day before, that they thought fit to
decamp during the night, and our troops took possession of the fort
without any opposition. Our army had now arrived within two leagues of
St. Pierre, from whence by day-break the enemy sent a flag of truce,
requiring three days to consider of a capitulation; to which General
Dundas returned an answer, that instead of three days, he would allow
them only three hours; and if they did not surrender within that time,
he would advance against the town. The fifty-fifth company of grenadiers
being left in possession of Bellvieu, the remainder of the battalion
moved on towards St. Pierré. In the mean time the Admiral, Sir John
Jervis, to co-operate with the land forces under General Dundas, had
ordered the following ships to sail for the bay of St. Pierre, the Asia,
Veteran, Santa Margarita, Blonde, Rattlesnake, Zebra, and Nautilus, with
the Vesuvius bomb. On board of this fleet Colonel Symes had embarked
with three light companies, and Major Maitland with a detachment of the
fiftieth regiment; Colonel Myers with five companies of the first
battalion of grenadiers, and five companies of the third battalion of
light infantry, (for the same purpose of co-operating with General
Dundas) had marched from Camp la Coste towards Trinité.</p>

<p>The fleet on their arrival in the bay prepared for instant operation.
Colonel Symes, with the troops and seamen who were to land with him,
had, previous to their entering the bay, embarked on board of the Zebra
and Nautilus sloops, and some other vessels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
which, being small, could get nearer the shore, thereby rendering the
debarkation of the troops much less difficult.</p>

<p>In the evening of Feb. 16th they began to work towards the north part of
the bay, beyond the Jesuits' College, the other men of war standing
towards the town to cover them. About eleven o'clock the vessels with
troops and seamen on board were under a cross fire from two batteries of
red hot shot, which happily did them no damage, though they fell round
and near them. Captain Harvey in the Santa Margarita, perceiving the
troops were likely to be much annoyed, went close under the guns of the
most considerable of the two batteries, which he silenced; and about
four in the morning of the 17th the troops and seamen made good their
landing, and found that the enemy had left the other battery. During the
night the Vesuvius bomb did much execution with her shells, many of them
falling in the town, to which it set fire in some places: the fire
however was soon extinguished. The batteries in the town and on the
adjacent hills kept up a constant fire of shot and shells on the men of
war, as they advanced towards the town, which was returned with great
spirit. The Santa Margarita was struck with a shell, which fortunately
neither fired her, nor did any considerable damage. Colonel Symes on
landing advanced with the troops towards St. Pierre, which the enemy
evacuated on his approach, leaving their guns primed and loaded, and
their colours flying, which were hauled down by our people, and the
British union hoisted. About ten the whole of the troops and seamen had
marched into the town. No man was suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
to quit his ranks, nor was the least injury done to any of the
inhabitants, who, with the women and children, sat at their doors and
windows to see our army march in, the same as when troops pass through a
town in England. While our men were drawn up in the market place, a flag
of truce came in from General Dundas, who with his army was on the hills
near the town, and was on his march to attack it. This flag was in
answer to one sent by the enemy to him, offering to capitulate. The
officer who brought the flag was agreeably surprised to find on his
entering the town that it was already in the possession of his
countrymen. In the evening General Dundas with the army marched in; and
having taken possession of the government-house, he instantly
established quiet and good order in the town. As our troops marched into
St. Pierre a drummer was discovered in the act of plundering one of the
peaceable inhabitants, for which he was instantly hung up at the gate of
the Jesuits' College, by order of the provost marshal. In the evening
the seamen embarked on board their respective ships. The men of war
having anchored in the bay, were busily employed in taking an account of
and unbending the sails of the different ships in the harbour.
Unfortunately at day-break of this morning, when the town surrendered, a
schooner got out of the south side of the bay, in which it was reported
there was a considerable quantity of money and some people of
distinction. She passed within gun-shot of the Santa Margarita, who (for
some reason or other) did not fire at her to bring her to. The next
morning the Santa Margarita sailed to Fort Royal bay with Mons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Au Cane<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>,
the mayor of St. Pierre, and Abbé Maunier, the vicar general of the
island, and other prisoners.</p>

<p>St. Pierre is a long handsome town, situated on the shore of an open
bay, and flanked by a strong battery at either end; also defended by two
redoubts on the hills which overhang the town. The surrounding country
rises in a succession of hills beautifully variegated with woods and
sugar plantations; and near the town are some fine gardens, which before
the revolution had been kept up in a superior stile of elegance and
convenience. Each street of this beautiful town is watered by a clear
stream from the mountains, running rapidly down the middle, which adds
greatly to the health as well as convenience of the place. The streets
in general are narrow and rough paved, but very regular; the houses are
built of a fine stone like free-stone, the lower apartments of which
were in general handsomely, and sometimes superbly, furnished.</p>

<p>There are two convents of nuns, one dedicated to St. Ursuline, the other
called Les Blancs. The Ursuline convent has very beautiful gardens,
situated at the declivity of a hill, which rises immediately behind the
town: it was in a wretched state when we took it, the poor nuns having
been deprived of their revenues by the revolutionists. Near this convent
is a neat church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
whose high altar, as well as pavement, is of good marble. Not far from
the church is the opera house, which, from its high roof, is a very
conspicuous object. Towards the south end of the town is the church of
Notre Dame de bon Porte du Mouillage (of which Pere Maunier, one of the
chiefs of the revolution, was curé). It is a handsome building: round
the grand altar (which is of polished and well sculptured marble) are
several tolerable paintings of saints and the Virgin Mary, as large as
life. Over the bridge, at the north end of the town, is another large
church, and several others, small and mean in their outward appearance
and inside decorations. I was informed that most of these churches were
well endowed before the revolution, and the religious houses were amply
provided for, as is the case in all parts of the new world where the
Roman Catholic religion is professed.</p>

<p>At the northern extremity of St. Pierre is a spacious handsome house,
with good offices, stables, and gardens, which formerly belonged to the
Jesuits, in whose district the town and surrounding country is situated.
The Capuchins and Dominicans had the two other parts of the
island.&mdash;The government-house, which on our taking it was inhabited
by Au Cane, the mayor, is conveniently situated near the centre of the
town, and was formed for the residence of the chief magistrate or
governor of the island. The rooms are large and lofty, and there is a
good garden at the back of the house, in which, amongst a variety of
fruit trees, was a fine bread-fruit tree: how it came there, I
could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
not learn, unless some French ships had paid a visit to the islands in
the South Sea, for the same purpose that our ships of late have made
that voyage; but then I think more of the trees would have been seen in
this and the neighbouring French islands.&mdash;Towards the southern end
of the town is a large and commodious hospital, which had good revenues
attached to it, and was well regulated and attended. This we found of
infinite use for our sick and wounded, who were far better provided for
here than they could be in the hospital ships, or with the army.</p>

<p>St. Pierre being now captured<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>,
the enemy's strength was concentrated in one point at Forts Louis and
Bourbon: the latter is a work of late date, being built under the
directions of the present Marquis de Bouillé, and is a well planned as
well as strongly situated fortification; but in this mountainous country
it is hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
possible to find any spot that may not be commanded by some neighbouring
height, unless on the tops of the mountains, where it would be difficult
to procure water and provisions sufficient for the subsistence of an
army during a siege of any length. The town of Fort Royal is situated on
a flat and swampy ground, at the foot of the hill on which is Fort
Bourbon; and Fort Louis, the ancient strong-hold of this island, is on a
neck of land running into the sea, and forms one side of the Carénage,
an excellent harbour for shipping of all kinds.&mdash;The Admiral, from
the day he anchored in Fort Royal Bay, began a heavy cannonade on Fort
Louis. The Vesuvius bomb, commanded by Captain Sawyer, and under the
direction of Captain Suckling of the artillery, threw shells into the
fort from an eighteen-inch and twelve-inch mortar with great effect; and
as soon as the evening shut in, the gun-boats, attended by several
row-boats from the ships in the fleet (to assist in case of their being
sunk by the enemy's shot) moved towards the mouth of the Carénage, and
commenced a brisk fire on the fort, which was generally returned with
equal spirit; but, from the smallness of the object, and frequently
shifting their situation, they were less often hit than could have been
expected, considering that they constantly were within the range of
grape-shot, which fell in showers round them. Towards day-break they
returned to their respective ships.&mdash;In the night of February 15th,
the second and third companies of seamen, under the command of
Lieutenants Miln and Ogle, left the Boyne; and, with other seamen from
the fleet, the whole under command of Captain Rogers of the
Quebec,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
landed at Cas Navire, and (occupying the posts that the troops under
Colonel Myers had that day quitted, to assist in the attack on St.
Pierre) formed a camp near Point Negro.&mdash;Our shipping having now,
by the capture of Pigeon Island, free ingress to Fort Royal bay, most of
the transports and store-ships, under convoy of his majesty's ships
Santa Margarita, Solebay, Nautilus, &amp;c. got up into the Cul de sac
de Cohée, an harbour at the north-east end of the bay, from whence they
had a communication with the army under Sir Charles Grey, and where they
built a wharf to land provisions and stores; and a chain of posts was
established from thence to the heights of Bruno, on which duty the
fifteenth and twentieth regiments were employed.&mdash;On February 18th
in the morning, General Bellgarde moved with nearly his whole force from
his camp on the heights of Sourier, to attack the landing-place in the
Cul de sac de Cohée, and by that means to cut off the communication
between the army and the fleet. Sir Charles Grey, with that quickness of
perception that has rendered him so often useful to his country,
instantly perceived his design, and without loss of time ordered the
grenadiers, under the command of Colonel Buckridge, and the light
infantry, under that of Colonel Coote, to advance with the utmost
expedition, and attack Mons. Bellgarde's camp at Sourier; and detached a
strong corps from the heights of Bruno to support them. They began their
attack on the enemy in the wood; and having driven them from thence,
began to mount the rugged and almost inaccessible sides of the hill on
which Sourier was situated. The troops gallantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
forced their way through every obstruction, and mounted the heights
under a heavy fire from the retreating enemy, whom they fairly drove up
the precipice, and gained the heights, where they found an excellent
dinner (provided for Bellgarde and his people) to refresh them after
their fatigue. Our loss in this affair<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
was by no means so great as might have been expected, considering the
length of ground, and the many disadvantages under which our troops
engaged. While this was doing, General Sir Charles Grey cannonaded
Bellgarde from the camp at Bruno, whose troops soon retired in confusion
to their late camp at Sourier, which they found occupied by the British
grenadiers, who turned their own guns on them (consisting of three brass
field pieces), and drove them in confusion under the walls of Fort
Bourbon. Our soldiers could not now be restrained, but with an
impetuosity that General Prescott could not for the moment prevent,
advanced so near the fort, that the enemy opening a heavy fire of grape
shot on them, obliged them at length to retire with some loss to their
new acquisition on Sourier, a post which Sir Charles Grey had intended
to have attacked the following day, as being absolutely necessary to
enable him to carry on his plan of attack against Fort Bourbon, and
which the temerity of Bellgarde had thus put into his hands a day
sooner.&mdash;The whole business of this action was conducted in such a
manner, that each individual concerned partook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of the glory of it; and when considered as to its utility, it was
perhaps one of the most fortunate, as well as the best conducted,
enterprises that happened throughout the campaign. The day after this
event General Rochambeau, who commanded in Fort Bourbon, sent an aid de
camp on board the Boyne, who went thence with Captain Grey to the
Commander in Chief at head quarters. The terms of capitulation that he
brought were, that the whole island should be delivered to the English
on condition that, in case Louis the Seventeenth should ever come to the
throne, it should be restored to him; if not, and the republic should be
established, it should be given up to that government. The Commander in
Chief returned for answer, 'that he came expressly to take this island
for his Britannic Majesty; and that he hoped to take all the French
islands in this quarter on the same account.'&mdash;The troops now
pitched their tents, and formed their camp on Sourier. General
Prescott's quarters were in this camp, where he commanded; and Sir
Charles Grey established his head quarters at a small distance in the
rear.&mdash;General Dundas having arranged every thing relative to the
government of St. Pierre, left Colonel Myers of the fifteenth regiment
with the battalions of the fifty-eighth and sixty-fifth regiments to
garrison that town, and on February 20th embarked with the grenadiers on
board the Veteran for Fort Royal Bay. The morning following they
disembarked in the Cul de sac de Cohée, and marched directly to head
quarters at Sourier, where they pitched their tents, and with regret
parted from General Dundas, their commander hitherto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
who went to Camp la Coste to take the command of the light
infantry.&mdash;The artillery, artificers, and engineers, were now
busily employed in landing stores and ammunition preparatory to the
formation of the batteries necessary for the siege; in which business
they received great assistance from a body of seamen landed for that
purpose: three hundred of these brave fellows were landed at the wharf
in the Cul de sac Cohée from his majesty's ships Santa Margarita,
Captain Harvey, with his Lieutenants Woolley and Harrison; the Solebay,
Captain Kelly, with Lieutenants Carthew and Schomberg; and Nautilus
sloop, Captain Carpenter; with Lieutenant Bennet, Lieutenant Collins,
and a party of marines, from the Santa Margarita. They instantly began
to proceed with a twenty-four pounder and two six pounders<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
towards Sourier. They halted with the twenty-four pounder that evening
on the side of the road between Fort Royal and the town of Lamantin, as
they were obliged to cut a road through a thick wood for nearly a mile.
The next day they completed the road, and also made a sort of bridge, or
rather passage, across a river, which at times was of considerable
depth, though fortunately there was now only four feet water in it. This
they effected by filling it up with large stones and branches of trees,
and then they proceeded with the twenty-four pounder and two eight-inch
howitzers, which they left that night in charge of a piquet from the
post above mentioned. On the third day they, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
astonishment of the whole army, got a twenty-four pounder to the heights
of Sourier before the night shut in, and two howitzers within a mile of
it; and to add to the difficulty, a considerable part of that day was
employed in levelling the banks of the river that runs by Dillon's
plantation, and making it fordable, by removing immense stones and
fragments of rock. On the fourth day (notwithstanding they were obliged
to employ a considerable party in making the road more complete) they
got the two howitzers above mentioned, and two more twenty-four
pounders, to the heights of Sourier. The distance from the wharf to
those heights is near five miles; and when we consider that the road was
to be formed for near four miles of the way, one of which was through a
very thick wood, and that, as they approached the heights of Sourier,
for near a mile the road was so steep, that a loaded mule could not walk
directly up it, it seems scarce credible that so small a number as three
hundred men should be able to have undergone such severe fatigue,
considering the climate and the nature of the soil, which was a very
stiff clay, intermixed with large rock stones.&mdash;A few days after, a
reinforcement of seamen was landed from the Veteran, Captain Nugent,
with Lieutenants Leaf and Whitlock, and the Winchelsea, Lord Viscount
Garlies, with his Lieutenants Dixon and Watson; also Lieutenant
Treminere of the marines, with a sergeant's party. They took post by the
side of the road leading from Lamantin to Fort Royal, where the first
twenty-four pounder was halted.&mdash;The first party of seamen took
post on the banks of the river running past Dillon's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
plantation, at the foot of the heights of Sourier. But the Veteran being
wanted for other service, in the course of the week one hundred and
fifty men were reimbarked on board her, and the Winchelsea's crew joined
the former party. The compliments paid the seamen in general orders for
their spirited conduct, is a convincing proof that they never once
relaxed from their first exertions from the beginning of the siege to
the surrender of Fort Bourbon, a period of five weeks. Indeed their
astonishing exertions were almost beyond probability: after rain (which
in this climate is frequent) the steep parts of the road were so
slippery, that a man even with the greatest care would frequently slip
back ten and sometimes twenty feet at a time: but so determined were the
honest tars not to fail in what they undertook, that when once they set
out with their gun after a heavy rain, and they found it impossible to
keep their feet, they have crawled up as they dragged the twenty-four
pounder, and kept themselves from sliding back by sticking their fingers
in the ground. But among the many compliments paid the seamen, none
pleased them so much as having a battery appointed solely for them<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>,
where they used to relieve one another by turns, without even an
additional allowance of grog as an encouragement. Sir Charles Grey
paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the highest compliments to the zeal and ability with which the Admiral
seconded all his plans. Indeed there never was an instance in which two
commanders carried on a business of such importance so unalloyed by the
least difference in opinion, or jealousy of command: each strove to
prove his readiness to assist his friend and colleague; of course every
thing succeeded, and was carried on with a promptness of execution that
seldom has been equalled, never exceeded.</p>

BOURBON SURRENDERS.</p>

<p>From the 20th of February Forts Bourbon and Louis, with the town of Fort
Royal, were completely invested, and the General was busily employed in
erecting batteries on his first parallel. On the north-east side the
army under General Prescott broke ground on the 25th of February, and on
the west side towards La Coste (where Sir Charles Gordon commanded,
Prince Edward not having as yet arrived from Canada) fascine
batteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
for mortars and cannon were erecting with every possible expedition. In
this business the seamen, who formed a camp at Point Negro under Captain
Josias Rogers of the Quebec, eminently distinguished themselves; and
though the roads were not quite so bad as on the Sourier side, yet they
had many severe difficulties to encounter, that rendered dragging the
mortars and heavy ordnance to the batteries fatiguing and hazardous in a
great degree. Part of the way which they were obliged to go was in sight
of Fort Bourbon; soon after which they descended into a hollow way or
ravine, where a rivulet invited them to refresh themselves, and it was
with difficulty their officers could prevent them from slaking their
thirst at this stream, which crossed them at a time when the fatigue and
heat they sustained rendered the temptation almost irresistible,
especially to men fearless of danger, and thoughtless to a proverb. No
sooner did they begin to descend into this ravine, than the enemy threw
their shells with such judgment, that they frequently fell at the moment
our people were passing the rivulet. It was in the afternoon of the 22d
of February that Lieutenant James Miln of the Boyne was proceeding with
his company of seamen to relieve those who had been the fore-part of the
day at work on one of the advanced batteries, and having been observed
on his march by the enemy in Fort Bourbon, they as usual began to fire
their mortars into the ravine; Mr. Miln, who, added to the greatest
courage, possessed much prudence, was hurrying his men through this
dangerous pass, and was in the act of calling to two men who were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
drinking at the rivulet (the rest of his company having passed on), when
a shell burst near him, carried off one of his legs, and shattered the
other in a dreadful manner. At the same time one of the men, who had
loitered, lost a leg. In this dreadful situation he was carried two
miles to Sir Charles Gordon's camp, before his wounds could be bound up,
and from thence to his own quarters at Point Negro, where he suffered
amputation of one leg. The next day the surgeon general of the navy went
to him from the Boyne, and finding his situation dangerous in the
extreme, having no better place than the ground, in an open sugar-house,
part of which was the head quarters of the naval officers, and being
within range of the enemy's guns, which frequently threw their shot and
shells over him, he was conveyed to the royal hospital at St. Pierre;
but from the loss of blood he had sustained, and the nature of the
climate, he was seized with the lock jaw, of which he died on Sunday the
9th of March, and the next day was buried in the garden of the hospital
with the honours of war, together with Lieutenants Spencer and
Rosehill<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
of the Beaulieu, and Lieutenant Smith of the fifty-eighth regiment. The
burial service was performed by the Chaplain<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
of the Boyne, and attended by Colonel Myers, commandant of St. Pierre,
Captain Salisbury of the Beaulieu, and the other naval and military
officers, and the principal English gentlemen who were in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
town. The Admiral, who always distinguished merit, and rewarded it when
in his power, had promoted Mr. Miln<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
to the command of the Avenger sloop, late Marseillois, taken at St.
Pierre.</p>

<p>Bellgarde found it in vain to attempt any thing further, after his last
shameful defeat; and being with his black army shut out of Fort Bourbon
by General Rochambeau (who, when he retreated after the loss of his camp
on Sourier under cover of the fire of that fort, shut the gates against
him), he now determined to make the best bargain he could for himself;
and accordingly on the 25th of February sent a message to Sir Charles
Grey, offering to give up his army, on condition that himself, and
certain others that he named, should be permitted to go to America;
which request the Commander in Chief complied with; and on the 4th of
March, Bellgarde, with his secretary, a white man, by whose councils he
had always been guided, and eight people of colour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
sailed in a schooner for America, whither he had taken the precaution at
various times to forward a quantity of wealth against any change of
circumstances should make such a retreat desirable<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the 4th of March his Royal Highness Prince Edward arrived at
this island, and was received with a royal salute from the fleet.
Immediately he took the command of that brigade of the army encamped on
the Cas Navire side, and at La Coste, which had hitherto been under the
direction of Sir Charles Gordon<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.&mdash;Intelligence
having reached the Commander in Chief that a number of brigands,
composed of some runaways from Bellgarde's army, and other wretches, had
committed many depredations and murders, pillaging and burning houses
and villages in several parts of the island; he dispatched a detachment
of the fifteenth regiment, commanded by Lord Sinclair, with a party of
the Prince of Wales's light dragoons, commanded by Lieut. Shadwell, and
conducted by Captain Cunningham (one of his Excellency's aid de camps),
who surprised one hundred and fifty of these people in the act of
burning and plundering the village of Francois<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.
At the first charge the enemy were routed, thirty-six of them, with
their chief (who was cut down by a dragoon), were killed, and four taken
prisoners, who were instantly hung up, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
deter others from such infamous acts as had been committed by these
miscreants.&mdash;Every preparation was now made for opening our
batteries against Fort Bourbon, which were constructed only about eight
hundred paces from the fort, and about six hundred in front of our own
lines. These batteries would have been constructed much sooner, but,
owing to the heavy rains that fell almost constantly, and which, at this
season of the year, were unusual, the works had been greatly retarded,
and the difficulties encreased. On the morning of the 6th of March,
every thing being ready for a heavy cannonade, Sir Charles Grey sent a
flag of truce with a summons to the garrison to surrender, which was
refused by General Rochambeau. Accordingly, at day-break on the 7th (the
gun-boats having as usual attacked Fort Louis during the night) mortars,
howitzers, and great guns, opened from five batteries at the same
instant, keeping up an incessant fire on the fort and advanced redoubt
the whole of that day and the night, from each of which it was returned
with equal fury. All the following day the same spirited attack and
defence was continued. On the 9th the enemy made a sortie <span
class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Original text was
'fron'.">from</span> the fort, and attacked the advanced picquet from the camp
at La Coste, composed of part of the third battalion of light infantry,
and some sailors under command of Captain Faulknor of the Zebra. After
an engagement of some length the enemy gave way, and were imprudently
followed by our troops under the guns of the fort; by this excess of
ardour we lost some men, while the enemy suffered but little. The
gun-boats and Vesuvius now kept up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
constant fire from Fort Royal Bay: in the former two seamen were killed
by grape, and part of the head of the bomb ketch was shot away. On the
13th a melancholy accident occurred in one of our batteries, which was
formed and manned entirely by seamen. Captain Faulknor of the Zebra, who
commanded in it, being provoked by the interference of an officer of
artillery in the works which one of the seamen of the Asia was employed
in, and the sailor not obeying him with alacrity, was provoked to strike
him with his sword, which unfortunately wounded him mortally, and he
died in a few minutes. Captain Faulknor was acquitted by the court
martial that was instantly summoned by the Admiral to investigate the
matter; and the circumstance of its happening in the heat of action,
when the least disobedience of orders involves the most fatal
consequences, as well, as that it appeared there was no premeditated
intention of killing the unfortunate man, but was a blow given from the
impulse of momentary passion; the sentence was confirmed and
approved.&mdash;From this time the siege was carried on with unremitted
exertion by night and day; shot and shells were constantly flying, and
new batteries daily constructed; so that our advanced batteries were at
length brought within five hundred yards of the fort, and not more than
two hundred from the redoubt: the latter indeed was so battered, that it
might with ease have been stormed; but the General knew that a mine
which communicated from the fort would involve in certain destruction
all who attempted so desperate an action; and therefore preferred the
more sure means of success, by regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and methodical approaches. On Monday the 17th of March two new batteries
opened on Fort Louis from Point Carriere, a neck of land that forms the
south-west side of the Carénage, and not more than two hundred yards
across the mouth of that harbour to the walls of the fort; one of these
was commanded by Captain Riou<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
of the Rose.&mdash;The French had a fine frigate called the Bienvenu,
which was anchored in the centre of the Carénage, on board of which it
was reported a number of English prisoners were confined, and were
consequently exposed to the fire of our batteries. Lieut. Bowen of the
Boyne formed a resolution to extricate his countrymen from their
perilous situation; and having obtained the Admiral's permission, and
approbation of his plan, at noon he boldly pushed into the harbour from
Point Carriere, where he had collected his boats destined for the
enterprise, well manned by tried and determined seamen. The instant he
appeared round the point, the enemy prepared to give him a warm
reception. The walls of Fort Louis were covered in an instant with
troops, which kept up an incessant fire of musquetry on him; at the same
time the frigate endeavoured to keep him off, by plying both her great
guns and small arms; but at length, intimidated by the boldness of the
attempt, they fled from their quarters, and Mr. Bowen at the head of his
men boarded the frigate, and took the captain, officers, and crew of her
prisoners without resistance. All this time the enemy in the fort
continued to pour vollies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
grape and musketry on the frigate, which was returned with great spirit
by the British seamen, who now turned their own guns upon them, and
would have brought her out of the harbour, but the sails being all
unbent, it was impossible in such a situation to bend them: the
tri-coloured flag, which was fastened to the gaff of the mizen, they
were not able to strike, though a sailor had the audacity to go aloft
for that purpose, scorning the musketry of the enemy. Mr. Bowen, seeing
no chance of getting the ship out of the harbour, and finding that the
English prisoners were in another vessel further up, from whence it was
rendered impossible to release them, contented himself with securing the
officers and crew of the frigate, whom he brought off, in spite of every
effort made by the republicans to prevent him. As the bullets were
flying thick around him, he suffered the Frenchmen to lie down in the
bottom of the boats, that they might not be killed by their own
countrymen; a very different conduct from what they had observed to our
people who were in the same situation<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.
In this business he lost only three men killed, and four or five
wounded. The success of this enterprise gave the Commanders in Chief
confidence, that a spirited attack by land and sea on Fort Louis would
succeed. Accordingly the Admiral ordered a number of bamboos of thirty
feet long to be cut and made into scaling ladders, connected with strong
line. The gun-boats and row-boats were collected in the bay round the
Point Carriere, and the sailors' camp at Point Negro, with Prince
Edward's camp at La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Coste and Cas Navire, held themselves in readiness to co-operate in the
grand attack. The navy to be employed in this business was under the
immediate direction of Commodore Thompson. On Thursday the 20th of
March, before day-break, the third battalion of grenadiers, commanded by
Lieutenant Colonel Buckridge, and the first battalion of light infantry,
commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Coote, marched by the hill on which Fort
Bourbon is situated from the camp on Sourier, unperceived by the enemy,
and took a position that gave them the command of the bridge that
connected the town of Fort Royal to the road leading up to that fort,
the batteries on the second parallel being ready, those on Morne
Tortenson and Point Carriere kept up a well-directed and heavy fire on
Fort Louis, and all the other batteries cannonaded Fort Bourbon during
the whole of the day and night of the 19th instant, and on the morning
also, till about ten o'clock, when the Asia of 64 guns, Captain Browne,
and the Zebra sloop of 16 guns, Captain R. Faulknor, got under way. The
Zebra led in towards the mouth of the harbour, receiving the fire of
grape and round, without returning a shot: the Asia had got within the
range of grape shot, when, to the surprise of every body, she wore and
made sail from the fort<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.
The Admiral, Sir John Jervis, had previously made the signal for the
rest of the fleet to be ready to second the attempt of these two ships,
by loosing the topsails of the Boyne, and lying at single anchor
ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
to slip and run in; on perceiving the Asia was foiled in her attempt,
and supposing, as she was under a heavy fire from the fort, that either
Captain Browne was killed, or that some other desperate accident had
happened, he instantly dispatched Captain George Grey of the Boyne to
take the command of the Asia, and if he could not get in, to run her
aground under the walls of the fort. Captain Grey soon returned, and
brought the pleasing intelligence that not a man was hurt on board of
the Asia. She then stood in again, and again put about, when near the
mouth of the harbour, and sailed from it. Captain Faulknor, seeing that
he stood no chance of being seconded by the Asia, and being all this
time under a dreadful fire from Fort Louis, boldly pushed in towards
that fort, still reserving his fire till he came close to the walls of
it; and then running his ship aground, plying his small arms and great
guns, he drove the enemy from thence, and leaping into a boat, scaled
the ramparts. Seeing the Zebra go in, all the boats with scaling
ladders, attended by the gun-boats, seemed to fly towards the scene of
action. Those from Point Carriere mounted the walls near where Captain
Faulknor had so gallantly run his ship, and seconding him, drove the
enemy out of the fort, hauled down the republican flag, and hoisted the
British union in its stead<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.
The storming party of seamen from the camp at Point Negro, under Captain
Rogers, landed at the town of Fort Royal, of which they soon took
possession, being aided by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the first battalion of grenadiers, under Lieutenant Colonel Stewart, and
third light infantry, under Lieutenant Colonel Close, from Prince
Edward's camp at La Coste.&mdash;While this was doing, Lieutenant
Colonel Coote kept up a heavy fire of musketry on the bridge and road,
over which the enemy were retreating to throw themselves into Fort
Bourbon; and Captain de Revigne covering the attack of the infantry by a
well-directed fire of some field pieces, the whole action was so
eminently successful in every part, that it is hard to say where was the
greatest glory, every one performing the service allotted to him in so
excellent a manner. General Rochambeau, seeing that all resistance would
now be useless, Fort Royal, his grand depôt of provisions and
ammunition, being lost, sent a flag to General Grey, offering terms of
capitulation; and commissioners being named, who met at the house of
Madame Dillon to arrange the preliminary articles of it, the terms were
finally adjusted and agreed to on the 22d instant; and the ratification
thereof being signed by the Commanders in Chief on both sides, on the
23d following, at four o'clock in the afternoon, his Royal Highness
Major General Prince Edward took possession of both gates of the fort
with the first and third battalions of grenadiers, and first and third
light infantry. On Tuesday the 25th of March, 1794, the garrison marched
out of Fort Bourbon, to the number of nine hundred men; and being
allowed the honours of war for their gallant<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
defence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
they marched down the hill with their colours flying; and laying down
their arms on the parade of Fort Royal, were embarked on board of ships
which took them immediately to France. Our troops, both army and that
part of the navy that had served (during the siege) on shore, lined the
road as the enemy passed; and entering the fort, they struck the French
and hoisted the British colours, changing the name from Fort Bourbon to
Fort George, in compliment to our gracious Sovereign, which it now
bears, and Fort Louis bears the name of Fort Edward.&mdash;At the
commencement of the siege the garrison of Fort Bourbon consisted of one
thousand two hundred men, which were reduced to nine hundred at the
conclusion of it. Five stands of colours laid down by the garrison, and
two colours of Fort Bourbon, were brought to England by Major Grey,
second son of his Excellency the Commander in Chief, and presented by
him (with the dispatches) to his Majesty, who ordered them to be hung up
in the Cathedral of St. Paul, as a lasting memorial of the gallant
action atchieved by Sir Charles Grey and Sir John Jervis, and their
brave forces<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>;
by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
which one of the most valuable of the French islands in the West Indies
was added to the British dominions, possessing (besides great revenues
and prodigious sources of wealth) one of the finest harbours in the
world, in which the whole British fleet might safely anchor.</p>

<p>On the 21st of March Captain Faulknor was promoted from the Zebra sloop
to the command of the Bienvenue French frigate of 40 guns, taken in the
Carénage of Fort Royal, and which was now named the Undaunted by the
Admiral, to express the greatness of that action, which finished the
capture of the whole island. At the same time Lieutenant Bowen was
promoted to the command of the Zebra sloop, for his gallant conduct on
the 17th instant, as well as at various other times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
The gun-boats, which by the French were called "Les Petit Diables," were
of infinite service, and gained the officers commanding them immortal
credit, by the steady and well-directed fire they kept up constantly,
both night and day, on Fort Louis; and though continually exposed to an
heavy fire both of grape and round shot, their loss was small, not more
than four killed and wounded, during the siege. The several ships of the
line contributed their aid, by sending row-boats armed to attend them in
case of accident.</p>

<p>His Excellency the Commander in Chief, having left Lieutenant General
Prescott to command at Martinique, with the fifteenth, thirty-ninth,
fifty-eighth, sixty-fourth, and seventieth regiments to garrison that
island, on the 30th of March he embarked the following troops on board
his Majesty's ships in the bay of Fort Royal, viz. the brigade of
grenadiers, commanded by his Royal Highness Prince Edward; the brigade
of light infantry, under command of Major General Dundas; and the sixth,
ninth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
forty-third regiments, commanded by Colonel Sir Charles Gordon; with
engineers under Colonel Dornford, and a detachment of Royal artillery,
with some light ordnance, under Lieutenant Colonel Paterson.&mdash;On
the 31st the Admiral made the signal for the fleet to sail by eleven A.
M. and by half past nine the next morning was off the north part of the
island of St. Lucia, where he lay to for the rest of the fleet that had
fallen to leeward. Every thing having been previously arranged between
the General and Admiral, they effected three different landings on the
island with little resistance, and no loss. By half past one P. M. Major
General Dundas's division, consisting of the third battalion of light
infantry, under Lieutenant Colonel Close, and conducted by Captains
Kelly and Lord Garlies of the navy, made good their landing at Ance du
Cap, not far from Le Gros Islet<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>;
and the second light infantry, under Lieutenant Colonel Blundell,
conducted by Commodore Thompson, at Ance du Chocque, who were ordered to
join the first column, taking the enemy's batteries in reverse, and to
occupy a position for the purpose of investing the works of Morne
Fortuné on the side of the Carénage; all which, notwithstanding a sharp
fire kept up by the enemy from several small batteries, was executed by
General Dundas with his usual spirit and abilities. As the Boyne and the
rest of the fleet passed along the coast they received the fire of many
small forts and batteries, without returning it; and though considerably
within the range of their shot, which passed over and through their
sails and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
rigging, not a man was hurt in any of them. At four P. M. the fleet
anchored in twenty fathom water, within a cable's length of the shore,
at Marigot de Rofeaux; at which place his Royal Highness Prince Edward
with the grenadiers landed about six o'clock in the evening, under the
immediate direction of the Admiral, and began their march soon after. At
night they halted on the heights opposite to Morne Fortuné, from which
they were separated by the Grand Cul de Sac, or Barrington's Bay. Soon
after sun-set, Lieutenant Colonel Coote, with the first battalion of
light infantry, landed from the Boyne at Ance de la Tocque, proceeded to
and took the four-gun battery of Ciceron, investing Morne Fortuné on
that side; at the same time covering Cul de Sac, or Barrington's Bay,
for the entrance of our fleet, which anchored there the next morning,
being the 2d of April. This morning early the Prince dispatched two
companies of grenadiers, with Lieutenant Smyth of the 7th regiment, his
brigade major, to attack two batteries on the coast, which they found
evacuated, with the tri-coloured flag still flying; this they brought
off with them, and spiked the guns. Sir Charles Grey, visiting the
Prince's quarters, found his men were halted in a very swampy and
unhealthy place, and ordered them to change their ground, and move on to
a house at the bottom of Morne Fortuné, which they performed that night
without any loss, though part of their road (near a mile in length) was
exposed to the fire of the fort on the Morne, as also of a little
two-gun battery on a point of land under the fort, which, as they passed
the ravine at the head of the Grand Cul de Sac, played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
upon them with round shot and grape: however, the distance was too great
for any mischief to happen from the latter. In their march they had to
pass a swampy thicket of plantain trees, which concealed them from the
view of the enemy, who nevertheless kept up a constant fire of random
shot; and though the distance was now very trifling, and the cannonade
extremely heavy for a long time, not a man was killed, and a few only
slightly hurt by the splinters of stones and rock which flew in great
plenty round them.&mdash;Early in the morning of the 3d of April,
Lieutenant Colonel Coote, with four light companies, stormed a redoubt
and two batteries close to the enemy's principal work on the Morne, and
killed two officers and thirty men, made one prisoner (a surgeon), and
liberated one British seaman from captivity: he then spiked six pieces
of cannon, and fell back to Morne Ferré, where he established his
quarters<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.
The Commander in Chief now determined to carry the works on Morne
Fortuné by assault, and accordingly a plan was formed for a general
attack to be made on it the next morning by the troops which now
invested it, aided by a party of seamen under command of Lord Garlies:
but General Ricard, perceiving the determined behaviour of our troops,
prevented the plan being put in execution, by agreeing to terms of
capitulation, which had been offered by Sir Charles Grey, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
had sent in Major Maitland with a flag of truce to summon the garrison
to surrender. The gates of the fort were put into our possession the
same evening by nine o'clock. On the 4th the enemy marched out of the
fort, with the honours of war, to the glacis, where they piled their
arms, and were embarked on board of transports, which conveyed them to
France, under conditions that they should not serve against his
Britannic Majesty during the war<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.
When his Royal Highness Prince Edward marched into the fort of Morne
Fortuné, and hoisted the British colours, he changed its name to Fort
Charlotte, in honour of his august parent.&mdash;Major Maitland had been
dispatched to Pigeon Island with a summons, which, by order of General
Ricard, was delivered up to his Majesty's troops on the same terms as
the Morne. The Commander in Chief left the sixth and ninth regiments,
with detachments of artillery and engineers, as a garrison for this
island, under the command of Colonel Sir Charles Gordon, who was
appointed governor till his Majesty's pleasure was known.</p>

<p>The island of St. Lucia had its name from the day, dedicated to the
virgin martyr St. Lucia, on which it was discovered. It is about six
leagues south of Martinique, and twenty-one north-west from Barbadoes:
it is fifteen miles long, and eleven broad; is very hilly, and covered
in a great many places with thick woods, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
whose timber the planters of Martinique and the neighbouring islands
build their houses and mills. The fustic and cocoa tree is found here
also in great abundance. This island has frequently changed its masters,
being alternately possessed by the French and English: it has many good
bays and harbours, and is well watered by several fine clear rivers. Two
of the mountains are said to have been volcanos. Morne Fortuné is a high
hill which overhangs Basse Terre, the principal town of the island. On
the summit of the Morne is a fortification, as yet unfinished; by nature
it is very strong, but art has done little for it; for, when the
outworks fall, the fort is incapable of withstanding a siege. We found
but little ammunition or military stores, and one small uncovered tank
was the only reservoir for water. Here is also a Pigeon Island, which is
called by the French Gros Islet, and is so strongly fortified both by
nature and art, that if it was well supplied with provisions and stores,
would be capable of braving a very formidable attack. The bay of the
Grand Cul de Sac is a fine harbour for ships of any size to ride in,
during the hurricane months.</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Arcy Preston, being promoted from a lieutenancy in the
Boyne to the command of the Rattlesnake sloop of war, sailed for England
this day, carrying Captain Mason, one of the aid de camps of the
Commander in Chief, and Captain Parker of the Blanche, with an account
of the further success of his Majesty's arms in the reduction of the
island of St. Lucia<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>,
happily effected without the loss of a single man, though there had been
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
good deal of cannonading from the enemy's batteries and works. The flank
battalions being reimbarked on board of their respective ships, and Sir
Charles Grey with his suite being as usual with the Admiral on board the
Boyne, the whole fleet weighed and made sail from this island by eight
in the morning of the 5th of April, and by nine at night they anchored
in Fort Royal harbour, Martinique. Thus, in the short period of
something more than two months, by the efforts of this army and navy,
inconsiderable indeed in numbers, but united in an ardent desire to
prove themselves faithful to their country, and strenuous to defend and
promote her welfare, and increase her consequence, was the British
standard a second time hoisted on the walls of a republican fortress,
and another island added to the British dominions.</p>

<p>To provide for the future order and good government of their conquests
was now the task of Sir Charles Grey and his friend and colleague, Sir
John Jervis; and as, in the attainment of them, their hearts and
counsels were in unison, so in this most arduous business were their
united exertions employed to establish a system of government for the
conquered islands, which might be equally serviceable to their country,
as conciliatory to the minds of the newly acquired subjects of it; but
at a moment like this, when they were pushing on from one field of
conflict and glory to another, it was impossible to render any system of
government perfect; they therefore thought that the best mode would be
to leave them a government which appeared to have been most desired by
the majority of the people, and which agreed better with our own forms
than the wild confusion of democratic and revolutionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
power. Accordingly, they for the present left them in the exercise of
their accustomed laws, such as they had been at the happiest period of
their own government, and which appeared best calculated to forward a
system of confidence among their own order, and to prepare them for that
form of government (we from experience know the blessings of, and) which
unquestionably, on the same experience, would become earnestly desired
by all ranks of people. To further also the desirable object of
conciliating the minds of the conquered by an act of moderation and
indulgence, the conduct of all civil affairs<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
was principally entrusted to those whose influence in the colony pointed
them out as proper to be confided in; and whilst every tendency to
licentiousness would be checked by the vigorous direction of General
Prescott under his military government, the former courts, for the
administration of justice agreeable to the laws and customs before the
revolution, were allowed to go on, that the affections and gratitude of
his majesty's new subjects might in the surest manner be attached and
secured. However an arrangement of officers, guided by the constitution
of the other British colonies, was not neglected, and accordingly
several nominations were made and transmitted home for approval. St.
Lucia was left in the same state, as to its government, as Martinique.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the 8th of April, the fleet<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>,
having the Commander in Chief on board, with the remainder of the forces
which were not left to garrison the two islands of Martinique and St.
Lucia, weighed anchor by seven o'clock A. M. and sailed from the bay of
Fort Royal on an expedition against Guadaloupe (the troops having been
previously shifted from the men of war to the transports). The Admiral
detached Captain Rogers in the Quebec frigate, Captain Faulknor in the
Blanche, Captain Incledon in the Ceres, and Captain Scott in the Rose,
to attack a cluster of small islands called the Saints, lying between
Dominique and Guadaloupe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
which they executed with much spirit and gallantry: having landed a
party of their seamen and marines, they carried them without any loss on
their part, on the morning of the 10th instant; and when the fleet
arrived the same morning off the islands, they had the satisfaction of
perceiving the union flag hoisted on their two commanding batteries.
These islands are valued principally on account of a small harbour,
where a few ships of war may ride in safety during the hurricane months;
and also that they overlook a good deal of the coast of Basse
Terre.&mdash;About noon on the 10th of April the Boyne and Veteran
anchored in the bay of Point à Pitre, off the village of Grozier, and
some more of the fleet in the course of the afternoon; but a fresh wind
and lee current prevented most of the transports from getting in till
the day after. Without waiting however for the arrival of all the
troops, the General determined to land those that were with him,
immediately; and accordingly the first and second battalions of
grenadiers, one company of the forty-third regiment, fifty marines, and
four hundred seamen detached by the Admiral, under the command of
Captain George Grey of the Boyne, made good their landing by one o'clock
in the morning of the 11th, under a severe fire from Fort Fleur d'Epée,
and a three-gun battery at Grozier. As it was impossible for them to
land without the latter being silenced, Lord Garlies in the Winchelsea
was ordered on that service, which he performed in a masterly manner,
laying his ship within half-musket shot of the battery, as near indeed
as the depth of water would allow him to approach; and after a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
smart fire for some time on both sides, he drove them from their guns,
and the troops then effected their landing without any loss. In this
business, though every shot from the battery hit some part of the
Winchelsea, cutting the masts and rigging, Lord Garlies was the only man
wounded, receiving a bad contusion in his face. Some more of the troops
having arrived on the 11th, the General, perceiving the enemy to be in
considerable force at the strong post of Fort Fleur d'Epée, determined
to attack them without loss of time, and accordingly arranged his plans
in the following order: the first division, under command of his Royal
Highness Prince Edward, consisting of the first and second battalions of
grenadiers and one hundred of the naval battalion, was to attack the
post on Morne Mascot, an height within musket-shot of the fort; the
second division, commanded by Major General Dundas, consisting of the
first and second battalions of light infantry, and one hundred of the
naval battalion, to attack the fort of Fleur d'Epée in the rear, and to
cut off its communication with Fort Louis and Point à Pitre; and the
third division, commanded by Colonel Symes, consisting of the third
battalion of grenadiers and the third battalion of light infantry, and
the remainder of the naval battalions, to proceed by the road on the
sea-side to co-operate with Major General Dundas. The soldiers were
particularly directed not to fire, but trust solely to the bayonet; and
the seamen, who were commanded by Captain Nugent and Captain Faulknor,
to use their pikes and swords; all which was most scrupulously obeyed;
the several divisions having marched earlier, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to the distance they had to go, that they might commence the attack at
the same instant. The signal for the attack, which was a gun from the
Boyne, was given by the Admiral at five o'clock in the morning of the
12th. The troops moved forward with the most determined intrepidity. As
they advanced to the first picquet the alarm was given; the out-posts
were driven in, or put to death; and in an instant the sides of the hill
on which the fort was situated were covered by our people, who scrambled
up, under a most tremendous discharge of grape shot and musketry: some
sailors jumped into the embrasures, driving the enemy before: the
soldiers, who had reached the gates, at length succeeded in forcing them
open, and a scene of dreadful conflict took place: the enemy still
continuing to make a stout resistance, were put to the sword in great
numbers; at length, as many as could escape through the gates and
embrasures, or by leaping over the walls, fled with the utmost
precipitation towards the town of Point à Pitre. Our victorious troops
soon followed, driving them across the Carénage to Basse Terre, whither
they and several of the inhabitants made their escape in boats, before
the Ceres and two gun-boats could get into the Carénage to cut off their
retreat, though this service was performed by Captain Incledon with the
greatest alertness. With Fleur d'Epée fell Hog Island, and Fort Louis,
an old fortification commanding the entrance into the harbour of Point à
Pitre, which town also was taken possession of at the same time by Sir
Charles Grey. Our loss in this action was considerable, in proportion to
the smallness of our numbers, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
fifty-four killed and wounded; the enemy lost in all two hundred and
fifty. Fort Fleur d'Epée is strongly situated on the summit of a hill,
two sides of which are towards the sea, from whence it has a very
formidable appearance; but being commanded by Morne Mascot, when that
falls into the power of an enemy it is of little consequence. On the
brow of the hill, a little below the fort, is an half-moon battery,
which commands a great distance along the coast. Among the many
accidents worth notice, I beg leave to mention the following, which I
hope will be a striking instance (among many of the same kind which have
happened this war) that it behoves all our people serving on shore,
whether military or naval, to be distinguished by red dresses. The
French, as well as several other continental troops, are dressed in
blue; of course, in the confusion of an assault, especially if it
happens before day-break, a seaman's blue jacket may, and I am convinced
often has, been the cause of his death by the hands of his own
countrymen. A seaman of the Boyne, belonging to the first company,
expressing a wish that he might have an opportunity of lowering the
French flag, and hoisting our own; and being a remarkably fine fellow,
was pitched upon to carry the union flag on this attack for that
purpose, in case the fort should be taken; and accordingly it was
wrapped in many folds round him, and he was to defend it as well as he
could. When he approached the fort, the first object that attracted his
notice was the flag-staff, and, regardless of every danger, he rushed
forward, pike in hand; and having once got into the fort, away he ran to
the desired spot, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
already struck the tri-coloured flag, and was endeavouring to disengage
himself from his wrapper, in order to hoist that in its stead, when some
soldiers coming suddenly round the corner of a building, and taking him
for one of the enemy, in an instant attacked him, and he fell severely
wounded before they discovered their mistake. I am happy however to add,
that the poor fellow, by the care and skill of Mr. Weir, the
surgeon-general<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
of the navy, recovered sufficiently to shew, before the end of the
campaign, that his courage was undiminished by the
accident.&mdash;Captain Faulknor, who had so eminently distinguished
himself at the capture of Fort Louis in Martinique, had a narrow escape
in this business: having led his men on to the assault with his usual
gallantry, he was encountered by a French officer, whom he instantly
struck at with his sword, which falling on the epaulette on his
shoulder, did not penetrate: the Frenchman closed with him, and being
the strongest man, threw him to the ground; and, wresting the sword from
his hand, was in the act of plunging it into his body, when fortunately
a seaman belonging to the Boyne, seeing the danger his gallant leader
was in, with his pike pinned his adversary to the earth.&mdash;As at
this time I was the only chaplain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
on the expedition (Mr. Ruxton, chaplain of the fifty-sixth regiment,
having died soon after his landing in Martinique), and several of our
men having fallen in this gallant attack, I went on shore up to Fort
Fleur d'Epée to pay the last honours to our unfortunate countrymen,
eighteen of whom were killed on the spot. The scene I beheld surpassed
my powers of description. It was early in the morning, soon after the
action was over. At the foot of the hill lay several of our seamen badly
wounded, waiting to be carried on board their respective ships: a little
further, under the tall trees that grew within a few yards of the sea,
several naval officers reposing after the fatigues of the morning, and
their men not far from them. As we went up the hill we met some of the
wounded prisoners brought in by our people; and at the gates of the fort
was an heap of the slain, who had all died by the sword or bayonet.
Within the fort the destruction appeared more dreadful, being more
confined; a multitude of miserable wretches expiring of their wounds,
and many of our own people in the same situation: in the midst of this
was his Excellency writing his dispatches on a table, on which, fatigued
with the action, an artilleryman was sleeping, whom the General would by
no means have disturbed; one proof among thousands that the truest
heroism may be, and often is, united to the greatest humanity.&mdash;It
would be invidious to mention particularly, who distinguished themselves
in this business, where all seemed emulous of glory; but as the greatest
responsibility is attached to the higher ranks, it will be but justice
to say, that Prince Edward, General Dundas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Colonels Symes, Cradock, and Coote, with the other officers of rank, as
also Captains Nugent and Faulknor, the officers commanding the naval
battalions, received the thanks of the Commander in Chief in public
orders, for their excellent conduct and resolution, displayed through
the whole of the action.</p>

<p>Point à Pitre is the capital of that part of Guadaloupe called Grand
Terre, which is separated from the other part, called Bass Terre, by a
narrow arm of the sea, in form of a river; it is called the river
Sallée. The town is neat and well built, but in an unhealthy situation,
being on the borders of a large extent of swampy land; it has a good
harbour called the Carénage, the entrance to which is guarded on one
side by an half-moon battery lately erected on Islet a Couchon, or Hog
Island, and on the other by the ancient castle of Fort Louis; it is also
defended on the land side by a hill called Morne Government, on which is
a strong battery. The country on this part of Guadaloupe is remarkably
flat, forming a strong contrast to Basse Terre, which gradually rises
from the sea-shore till it forms a chain of hills extending from one end

<p>On the 13th, the forty-third regiment being landed to garrison Fort
Prince of Wales (late Fleur d'Epée), the town of Point à Pitre, and the
other ports on Grand Terre, the General and the rest of his army
reimbarked on board of their respective ships; and in the evening the
Sea Flower brig, Captain Pierrepoint, sailed for England with
dispatches. At twelve o'clock the next day, the Quebec and the other
frigates, with the transports, sailed over to the other side of the bay;
and in the afternoon the troops, consisting of the grenadiers and light
infantry, commanded by his Royal Highness Prince Edward, landed at a
village called Petit Bourg, where many of the principal people of the
island were assembled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
who received the Commander in Chief and the Prince with the greatest
demonstrations of joy. A party of sailors also, under the command of
Captain Rogers of the Quebec, landed at the same time. That night the
General returned to the Boyne; the next morning he landed at St. Mary's,
where he found Colonel Coote, with the first battalion of light
infantry, who had marched in before day-break from Petit Bourg. The
troops now marched forward, principally along shore, without any
remarkable occurrence, and halted for the night at a small village
between Cabes Terre and Petit Bourg. On the 16th the troops, still
advancing along shore, reached Trou Chien, a very strong post, which the
enemy had abandoned; and before dark the army halted on the high ground
over Les Trois Riverres, from whence they saw the enemy's two redoubts
and their strong posts on the heights of Palmiste. The General intended
to have attacked the enemy that night; but the troops were too much
fatigued from the long and difficult march they had just finished. Here,
at a beautiful plantation belonging to Monsieur Bellisle, the Prince and
several of his officers were sumptuously entertained at supper by that
gentleman, who repeated his hospitality the next day. All this time the
Admiral stood off and on near the shore, to be ready to pour in
assistance in case there should be any necessity for it: but on the army
retiring up the country towards Palmiste on the 17th instant, he came
round towards the town of Basse Terre. Fort St. Charles fired a few shot
and shells at the Boyne without effect. At half past one P. M. we were
becalmed off the town, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
a beautiful view of the country round it, which, rising gradually
inland, presents a varied amphitheatre of plantations, woods, hills, and
vallies, interspersed with elegant and well-built houses, ornamented by
many fine plantations of palms, cocoa-nut, and other tall and majestic
trees. By five P. M. we anchored in Ance de Baillif, about a mile from
the town of Basse Terre, which was hid from our view by an high point of
land forming the bay. On the 17th Major General Dundas, with the third
battalion of grenadiers, and second and third battalions of light
infantry, landed at Vieux Habitant, some miles north-west of Basse
Terre, meeting with little opposition and no loss, taking possession of
Morne Magdalene, and destroying two batteries, then detaching Lieutenant
Colonel Blundell with the second battalion of light infantry, he in the
night forced several difficult posts of the enemy. On the 17th General
Sir Charles Grey made a disposition for the attack of a redoubt called
d'Arbaud, and a battery named d'Anet, both near Grand Ance; the troops
pushed forward, and halted within a league of the village of Trois
Riviere. By day-break on the 18th Lieutenant Colonel Coote, with the
first battalion of light infantry, attacked and stormed the battery;
every man in it was either killed, wounded, or made prisoner, and not
one of our own was hurt. At the same time the grenadiers were ordered to
advance against the redoubt, which was commanded by this battery, and
which they found had been deserted by the enemy early in the night, who
burnt and destroyed every thing in and near it. On the night of the 17th
instant, the enemy in the town of Basse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Terre (being divided in their opinions, and party running very high
among them) set fire to the town, the whole of the west end of which was
consumed, containing much valuable property, and many fine houses. The
motives for this mischief we never could learn, as they were at that
time in full possession of the town; and as it was entirely commanded by
Fort St. Charles, there could be no danger of its falling into our hands
until the fort was taken. At one o'clock in the morning of the 20th, the
Commander in Chief, at the head of his troops, advanced to the attack of
the principal dependance of the enemy, which was a chain of batteries on
the heights of Palmiste, extending above a league. The grenadiers were
commanded by Prince Edward, and the light infantry by Lieutenant Colonel
Coote. At five in the morning the attack commenced by the light infantry
advancing to the assault of the highest and most formidable battery,
which, though well defended by nature and art, was soon obliged to yield
to the superior activity and bravery of our troops, who with their
bayonets forced the works, putting thirty of them to death. It is
remarkable, that in this affair the three first sentries at the advanced
batteries, on firing their muskets on the alarm, shot two advanced men
of the light infantry and their guide. The instant our men had made
themselves masters of this post, perceiving that it commanded all the
others, they with infinite spirit and address turned the guns against
them, under cover of which our troops marched up and took them all in
succession, without much further opposition, although, by every
appearance, they had determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to make a vigorous resistance, having felled trees and laid them across
the road, and at the entrance of their batteries, and the guns being
mostly loaded with grape-shot, or bags of musket balls, it seemed as if
they expected to have come to close quarters. General Dundas had now
formed a communication with Sir Charles Grey by Morne Howell, and the
Palmiste (the key of the town and Fort St. Charles) being thus in our
possession, the governor, Monsieur Collot, sent a flag of truce to Sir
Charles Grey, offering to deliver up Guadaloupe and its dependencies on
the same terms as had been granted to General Rochambeau at Martinique,
and Ricard at St. Lucia: the garrison to march out with the honours of
war, and lay down their arms, and to be sent to France, on condition
that they should not serve against the British forces and their allies
during the war; General Collot and his suite to be allowed a certain
time to settle their affairs, and to be conveyed to North America in a
frigate. Accordingly, the light infantry being left in the batteries on
the Palmiste, the remainder of the troops marched down and took
possession of the gates of both town and fort that night. The next day
the Boyne weighed anchor, and was towed by boats round from the bay of
Baillif to the road of Basse Terre, where she anchored within a cable's
length of the shore. At night a design of the garrison, to rise upon our
people and murder them, was happily made known to General Dundas, who
instantly rode down to the fort, and took the necessary precautions to
prevent the completion of this infamous plot. At eight o'clock in the
morning of Tuesday the 22d of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
April the French garrison of Fort St. Charles marched out, consisting of
fifty-five regulars of the regiment of Guadaloupe, and the fourteenth
regiment of France, and eight hundred and eighteen national guards and
others; Prince Edward, with the grenadiers and light infantry, taking
possession immediately, struck the republican and hoisted the British
colours, changing the name of it to Fort Matilda. From the returns found
among General Collot's papers it appeared that the number of men capable
of bearing arms in the island of Guadaloupe was at that time five
thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven; and the number of fire-arms
actually delivered out to them was four thousand and forty-four<a
name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.
On the 26th Prince Edward with his suite embarked on board the Blanche
frigate, commanded by Captain Faulknor, and sailed for North America;
his regiment, the seventh or royal fuzileers, being stationed at Quebec.
The spirit and enterprise of his Royal Highness on this expedition, with
his strict attention to discipline, merits the highest applause, and
deservedly gained him the respect and esteem of all who served with him.
Before the troubles (occasioned by the revolution) commenced in these
islands, the town of Basse Terre was a place of very considerable
traffic, and much resorted to by merchants and others: it is regularly
built, well watered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and beautifully situated on the sea-shore, and well defended by several
batteries and forts, particularly to the eastward by Fort St. Charles
(now called Fort Matilda), which is a regular fortification of great
strength and extent; but being commanded by surrounding high lands,
particularly Houelmont, a steep hill, on which is a battery that
overlooks, not only the fort and town, but the bay, and much of the
country near it, it is incapable of maintaining a long defence against a
powerful attack by land, but is impregnable by any that can be made
against it from the sea only. In the centre of the main street is a
spacious walk shaded by handsome well grown trees, which forms an
agreeable relief from the heat which in this climate is so very
oppressive. Above the town is a large and commodious hospital, which at
this period we found of infinite use. The island of Guadaloupe was
discovered by Columbus, who named it after some mountains in Spain to
which it bore resemblance, but by the native Caraibs it is called
Karukera: it is situated thirty leagues N. W. from Martinique, and is
reckoned the largest and most valuable island the French held in these
parts; and, from its vicinity to Antigua and Dominica, as well as to
several of our smaller islands, is of great consequence to us. The
island is divided into two parts by a narrow channel called La Riviere
Sallée, or the Salt River: the eastern part is called Grand Terre, and
is comparatively flat; it is nineteen leagues long and nine broad: the
western part is properly called Guadaloupe, but is now known by the name
of Basse Terre, and is again subdivided (by a ridge of mountains
extending from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> one end to the other) into Capes Terre and Basse
Terre: this part of the island is thirteen leagues and a half in length,
and about seven at the broadest part. The islands immediately dependent
on Guadaloupe are Marigalante, Deseada, and the Saints. Marigalante is
of a round form, about forty miles to the S. E. of Guadaloupe; it is
about five leagues long and four broad, and was discovered by Columbus
in 1493, who gave it the name of his own ship. Deseada, or Desirada
(that is, the Desirable Island), was the first of these islands
discovered by Columbus in his second voyage in 1493; it is about fifteen
miles N. E. of Guadaloupe, and is not very fertile. The Saints are a
cluster of islands on the S. E. side of Guadaloupe, of which the
westernmost is called Terre de Bas, or the Low Island; the easternmost
the High Island: there is a good harbour here for a few ships. These
islands received the name of Sanctos from the Spaniards, who first
discovered them on All Saints day. There is some good land in the
valleys, but the hills are covered with rocks.&mdash;Thus, in the short
period of three months, concluded a campaign, in which three valuable
islands and their dependencies were added to his majesty's dominions. To
the unanimity which subsisted between the Commanders in Chief, together
with their allowed high professional knowledge, and seconded by the
spirited conduct of all the inferior ranks, must this unlooked-for
success be attributed, as the force employed to effect it was certainly
far short of what it ought to have been for so great an enterprise. The
originally small army was now obliged to be divided, to garrison and
secure our newly-acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> possessions; the fatigue became the
more burthensome, and the troops that had gone through the campaign with
unexampled bravery and patience, at length began to feel the effects of
a climate, that even in peaceable times is often found too trying for
European constitutions; and which was at this period rendered tenfold
more severe by that dreadful malady the yellow fever, which, though it
had subsided when we first came to the West Indies, was now, as it were,
awakened by the arrival of fresh victims, and acquired more strength
from the small resistance that could be made against it by constitutions
already broken by fatigue under hardships and difficulties
unparalleled.&mdash;As there were no expectations of any reinforcements
of consequence being sent till November, the General determined to
return to England, after he had made a proper arrangement to render the
conquests permanent, and secure them against any attempt that might be
made by those perturbed spirits that, notwithstanding his utmost
vigilance, might remain in the colonies; and which he in a short time
effected to his satisfaction, so far as it related to any attempt that
could be made by the enemy in these parts: but it is not to be imagined
that, with the small number of men he originally brought out, now
reduced by a variety of causes to half their number, and daily
decreasing in an alarming degree, any resistance could be made against a
strong reinforcement, if the French nation should be able to send out
one, from Europe<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.
Previous to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
his return, however, he was determined to leave the islands in the best
possible state of defence; and for that purpose he, with the Admiral,
visited all the islands in this quarter, inspecting the strong posts and
fortifications, while the Admiral paid attention to the naval department
in each; and in the beginning of June, after having taken formal leave
of the army in general orders, he sailed for Europe.</p>

<p class="small blockquot">THE CHARGES OF EXTORTED CONTRIBUTIONS AND
OPPRESSIONS, ALLEDGED AGAINST THE COMMANDERS IN CHIEF BY CERTAIN
INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS, REFUTED &hellip; THE REAL CAUSES OF THE LOSS
OF GUADALOUPE.</p>

<p>After having given an account of the glorious success which had crowned
the exertions of our gallant commanders and their forces, I now enter
upon a less pleasant task, the loss of Guadaloupe, since followed by the
capture of some other islands: but I do it the more willingly, because
in the simple facts it will be my duty to detail, the real cause of
those misfortunes will <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's
Note: Original text was 'apppear'.">appear</span>, and a clear refutation ensue
of those gross calumnies, originally propagated by avarice, fraud, and
falsehood, and repeated by ignorance and malice, which have endeavoured
to fix a stigma on two commanders, whose integrity of heart and openness
of conduct are as demonstrable, as their bravery is acknowledged.</p>

<p>The accusation of plunder, confiscation, and <i>extorted contribution</i>, is
founded on a tale, of which half only has been told, and that half with
intentional inaccuracy.</p>

<p>It has always been understood that property found in any place taken by
storm or assault became the legal prize or booty of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the captors; consequently the Commanders in Chief found no hesitation or
difficulty in considering the produce, merchandise, &amp;c. afloat and
on shore at St. Pierre and Fort Royal (both which were literally so
taken) as justly liable to forfeit and confiscation. The estates of the
emigrant royalists had been sequestered, and the produce of them sold by
the agents of the republic; consequently all manufactured or collected
produce on them became in like manner, by his majesty's gracious bounty,
the right of the captors.</p>

<p>If what is found in places or vessels taken by assault be not considered
as legal prize, what is? Is no booty, no prize money, to be the reward
of successful heroism, after the dreadful fatigues, diseases, and
dangers of war? Where then will be the spur to noble actions? Where the
spirit that impels the soldier and the sailor to brave the horrors of
arms and elements, of raging sickness, of excruciating death?</p>

<p>All the produce and merchandise found in the town of Fort Royal and on
board the vessels in the Carénage, and the same in the town and bay of
St. Pierre and in Trinité in the island of Martinique, and at Basse
Terre and Point à Pitre in Guadaloupe, were disposed of by public
auction for the benefit of the captors: but those on the estates,
manufactured and packed ready to be brought down to the ports for
embarkation, were not sold at this time, because persons came forward on
the part of the inhabitants themselves, and proposed a contribution, in
lieu of that part of the property, as falling more easy on them, and
consequently being preferable to confiscation; though they did not at
that time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
pretend to dispute the legality of the forfeiture. The Commanders in
Chief acceded to this <i>their own proposal</i>, through a pure wish of
accommodation. The exorbitant and unprecedented contribution, therefore,
levied on an unwilling people, turns out to be an <i>offered compromise
for an undisputed prize, received by a merciful and tender conqueror out
of kindness to the conquered</i>.</p>

<p>How well bestowed this kindness was, how deserved the confidence placed
in the honour of these people, will appear by the sequel! They received
back the forfeitures, and then endeavoured to get rid of paying the
compromise (themselves had offered) by infamous misrepresentations of
the conduct of those Commanders, of whose generosity they made use, to
defame, and then to rob them! For no sooner had they shipped off the
property, and got it safe away from the power of the Commanders, than
they began to demur at paying the stipulated sum, particularly at St.
Lucia, which island had agreed to pay one hundred and fifty thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>Situated as I was, and having an opportunity of drawing my conclusions
on the spot, I venture, with a very strong confidence of its truth, to
relate the following as the secret history of this business. An agent
for the prizes at St. Lucia, joining one of the agents who had already
been employed in the sale of the vendible property at Martinique
(possibly piqued by some diminution of confidence which the Commanders
in Chief from good reason had betrayed towards them), no sooner met the
inhabitants of St. Lucia, whom he had convened on the subject of raising
the stipulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
compromise for the plunder, than he offered, with an unparalleled
duplicity, while confessing himself sent on the part of the captors, to
suggest a mode by which the payment of this debt of honour might be
evaded. "Send," said he, "an immediate deputation to the English
government, anticipate the story of the Commanders, and a prohibition
will instantly issue." The deputation was sent without loss of time:
they relied on securing a large body of English merchants, particularly
those in the West Indies, on their side; and their reliance was well
placed, for they relied on that which they could easily prove to be
their interest. The truth is, that many of these West India traders<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
had carried on an illicit traffic to the French islands before they were
captured; and in consequence of it had at the time of the capture
immense sums still due to them. Apprehending, therefore, that the
payment of this contribution might retard, or even endanger, the
discharge of their own debts, they joined heartily in every scheme for
defeating this just and prior claim. They encouraged the French in their
opposition; they misrepresented the facts to England; they attempted to
blast the laurels of the Commanders; and became clamorous against the
cruelty of plunder, and illegality and impolicy of confiscation, that
they might enjoy the rewards of their own treason. While this plot was
secretly carrying on, and a heavy storm brooding over their heads, the
General and Admiral were proceeding in their expedition against
Guadaloupe, little suspicious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
till the dispatches from England discovered the success with which the
artful stories of this party had been attended.</p>

<p>Thus was the unparalleled good order and discipline with which the army
and navy had abstained from plundering the towns of St. Pierre, Fort
Royal, and Trinité, &amp;c. rewarded! This was the recompence of the
ruinous and expensive service in which the officers had engaged; of the
unexampled sufferings and dangers which they and their brave men had
undergone. Is not contribution in lieu of booty, the custom of war? Was
it not the case with Prince Ferdinand in a former war, through every
town and village of Germany<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>?
Did not the Marquis de Bouillé levy a heavy contribution on the island
of St. Christopher's, when taken by the French in 1782? Where then could
contribution ever be proper if not here? Here was no capitulation; but,
though the islands fell by storm, the Commanders, acting on the purest
principles, to save the persons and property of the inhabitants from the
plunder<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
of an enraged soldiery, agreed to accept as a recompence due to the
forbearance and good conduct of that body, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
composition the most easy to the conquered; and yet their fame has been
vilified, and the hard-earned pittance of booty snatched away! for none
of the contributions were ever paid, except a part at St. Lucia, <i>which
was afterwards refunded</i>. Surely this is small encouragement for such a
desperate service! If such be the future prospects of our army and navy,
their spirits will droop, and half that ardour that generates success
subside!</p>

<p>I shall now mention the real cause of the loss of Guadaloupe, which,
with that of some other islands that have since fallen, has been
maliciously attributed to the oppression and peculations of Sir Charles
Grey and Sir John Jervis; for this purpose I must refer back to the time
when the expedition was first planned by our government, and the command
given to those officers. As the capture of the French possessions in the
West Indies was rightly judged to be of the greatest consequence both in
a political and mercantile view, a very formidable armament was
prepared, and Martinique was pitched on as the first object for attack;
and, since the capture of that island had been attempted the year
preceding, and failed, it was of course expected to be put on its guard,
and rendered thereby more difficult. But at this period (unfortunately
for this expedition) another object diverted the attention of
government, and eight regiments<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>,
with a great part of the artillery, which were embarked and ready to
sail, were taken from that force, which combined would in all
probability have secured to us our conquests in the West Indies, and
enabled us to extend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
them to St. Domingo, and all the other French islands in that quarter.
Government was well aware, and acknowledged, that this diminution of
force must so cripple the expedition, that it would render the prospect
of any success doubtful; and no idea was entertained that the conquest
of Martinique would even have been attempted, Fort Bourbon alone seeming
too formidable for an attack by such an inconsiderable body: however,
when Sir Charles Grey and Sir John Jervis arrived at Barbadoes, and had
arranged every thing for an active campaign, they determined to begin
with the strongest island, being confident that, when that was gained,
the smaller places would soon fall; whereas, by attacking the lesser
islands first, they must necessarily diminish their small armament, and
render the capture of so well defended and strong a place as Martinique,
with the formidable fortress of Fort Bourbon, totally impossible. The
event justified their determination. But when this great object was
gained, and St. Lucia and Guadaloupe taken, the army (originally too
small) was divided into three parts to garrison the conquered places;
and by that dreadful scourge, the yellow fever, which now began its
ravages, together with the loss sustained in the several actions of the
campaign, not one of the islands, nor indeed a single post on each,
could be called properly defended, in case the French should send out an
armament to the West Indies. If, as soon as the news of the capture of
the first island had reached England, a strong reinforcement could have
been sent out, and repeated on the conquest of each succeeding place,
the small body of the enemy (who made their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
attack on Guadaloupe, and stole in at a moment when the gallant
governor, General Dundas, was breathing his last, and when every post
was reduced to extremity by sickness) would with ease have been
repelled, or perhaps their whole party taken.&mdash;In the succeeding
part of this work it will be my business to detail the events that
gradually led to the evacuation of this island, and gave the enemy such
advantage as enabled them since to extend their conquests to some other
inferior places.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 3d of June, Major General Thomas Dundas, the
governor of Guadaloupe, became the victim of that dreadful fever, which
once more began to desolate these islands. He was ill only three days.
By his death the army in the West Indies suffered an irreparable loss,
and the service in general one of its brightest ornaments. Amiable both
in public and private life, brave and generous, possessed of that true
courage which never exceeds the bounds of humanity, he justly gained the

At this inauspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
moment an armament arrived from France, under the direction of two
commissioners from the national assembly. It consisted of two frigates,
one corvette, two forty-fours armed en flute, and two other ships, with
about one thousand five hundred land forces on board of them<a
name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.
They instantly made good their landing on Grand Terre; and, after two
unsuccessful efforts, at last succeeded in their attack on Fort Fleur
d'Epée, which they carried by storm<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.&mdash;As
soon as this news reached Colonel Blundell, he instantly dispatched a
schooner to St. Christopher's, with an account of it to the Commanders
in Chief, which fortunately found them there, the Boyne being off Old
Road taking in water for her voyage to England. Sir Charles Grey was
busy in inspecting the works on Brimstone Hill. The Commanders in Chief
instantly determined to return to Guadaloupe, and accordingly pushed,
under a press of sail, for Basse Terre, where they arrived in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
afternoon of the 7th of June, and were joined by the Resource, Captain
Ross, and the Winchelsea, Captain Lord Garlies; on board of which ships
General Grey and his suite embarked to be landed at Basse Terre, in
order to visit the ports in that quarter, and to give the necessary
instructions for future operations. The Admiral ordered the Nautilus,
Captain Bayntun, to proceed to Martinique, with orders from Sir Charles
Grey for a reinforcement from thence, and himself proceeded in the Boyne
to the Bay of Point à Pitre. On his passage he met Commodore Thompson
with his squadron from Martinique, coming round the point of Vieux Port.
On their joining, he ordered the Solebay and Avenger into Basse Terre
Road, to carry the General's further orders into execution, touching
reinforcements from the different islands.</p>

<p>At noon of the 8th of June, the Boyne and the rest of the fleet anchored
off Grozier, and saw the union jack displayed on Fort Fleur d'Epée as a
decoy to British vessels, which we found had been successful in several
instances; from hence, too, we had a view of the French fleet lying in
the harbour of Point à Pitre. The Admiral, without delay, arranged every
thing in his department to prevent a surprise from any future
reinforcements of the enemy which might arrive. At day-break of the 9th,
the enemy in Fort Fleur d'Epée, on hoisting their colours, opened an
heavy fire of round and grape-shot on the Boyne, as did the two-gun
battery at Grozier on the rest of the fleet, but happily without any
material damage to them. This morning the London transport,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
having troops on board, got on shore on the Basse Terre side of the bay.
Lieutenant Thompson of the Boyne, was sent with the launch to take the
men out of her; in doing which he was exposed to a severe fire from a
battery on Islet a Couchon, or Hog Island; but he succeeded in removing
them without any loss. In the evening Sir Charles Grey and his suite
came on board the Boyne,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
from whence he could for the present with greater ease arrange his
troops, and communicate with them at their different posts. This day
also Lord Viscount Garlies in the Winchelsea frigate attacked the
two-gun battery at Grozier, where he had distinguished himself in the
last campaign, and once more drove the enemy from their guns: but very
few troops having yet arrived, no attempt could be made to land there,
as before. The Boyne having been much annoyed by the fire of Fort Fleur
d'Epée and Grozier battery, was now warped a cable's length further from
the shore. On the 11th, in the morning, several boats full of men,
attended by a gun-boat, were discovered making towards our post at Petit
Bourg, from the harbour of Point à Pitre: their intention seemed to be
to attack a transport and sloop of ours. The Winchelsea frigate was
ordered towards them, and receiving the fire of the battery on Hog
island, and another near Fort Louis, she obliged them to return into the
harbour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
The enemy had crossed the river Sallée to Basse Terre, and had taken
post at Berville, a fine plantation belonging to a gentleman of that
name. They instantly set fire to the house, and destroyed all the mills,
sugar-works, and store-houses, belonging to it, to a very large amount;
they then encamped at the post of St. Jean, or Gabbare, a point of land
opposite to the harbour of Point à Pitre. General Grey thought this a
favourable moment to attack them, which was accordingly done at eleven
o'clock at night on the 13th, under the command of Brigadier General
Dundas, who with the 1st light infantry led by Brevet Major Ross, with
the 39th regiment under Major Magan, and a <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber's Note: Original text was 'dedetachment'.">detachment</span>
of artillery and two field-pieces, attacked the enemy with such
determined bravery, that after a severe conflict they fled in the utmost
disorder, precipitating themselves into the sea in order to swim across
the harbour to Point à Pitre; but few succeeded in the desperate
attempt, many being drowned, and more shot by our light infantry, who
followed close at their heels: they left one hundred and seventy-nine
dead on the field; our loss was trifling, seven men killed and twelve
wounded. The enemy's camp, colours, baggage, and ammunition, with one
piece of cannon, fell into our hands.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
The light infantry and the 39th regiment remained at Berville, having
for their advanced post Savonge, and St. Jean on the banks of the river
Sallée. On this point of land, which runs into the harbour of Point à
Pitre, Captain Pratt, commanding a detachment of artillery, was ordered
to erect a battery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of two twenty-four pounders and two howitzers, which he effected with
such dispatch, that by the next morning it was completed, and opened
with a most tremendous fire on the republican frigate La Pique, lying
within gunshot of the shore, to the no small surprise and astonishment
of the commodore, who was then on board. The frigate retaliated, and a
brisk fire was kept up for some time, when she thought it advisable to
weigh anchor, and take shelter under the guns of her own batteries,
after having lost between forty and fifty of her crew in killed and
wounded, and being much damaged in her hull and rigging. On the 14th the
Roebuck, Captain Christie, arrived with troops (draughted from several
regiments), and two gun-boats also came very seasonably; one of which,
under command of Lieutenant Wolley of the Boyne, attacked the battery at
Grozier, and again made the enemy retire from their guns.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>On Thursday the 19th of June, General Grey once more made good his
landing on Grand Terre, about six miles to windward of Grozier, under
cover of the Vanguard, Veteran, Vengeance, Solebay, and Winchelsea, and
immediately moved on to Grozier, from whence he drove the enemy, who
retreated towards Fort Fleur d'Epée, burning the houses and sugar-works
that lay in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
road.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
About this time Lieutenant Macnamara, of the marines, was sent to
Deseada to secure that island against any attempt of the enemy. On his
landing he was attacked by a party of the inhabitants, who had formerly
surrendered the island to us, aided by some brigands and a mixed rabble.
In a short time, however, he drove them to the mountains, having killed
twelve, and hung up six, as an example to deter others from similar acts
of rebellion. On the 20th the enemy sunk one of our gun-boats by the
fire of their battery on Hog Island, but none were killed in her. On the
21st they set fire to, and burnt a fine house on the heights of Mascot,
near Fleur d'Epée, leaving the foundation walls only standing. Our
troops now encamped at Grozier were employed in erecting batteries
against Fort Fleur d'Epée, as the enemy were in too great force for our
reduced numbers to attempt an assault on their principal work. On the
22d the Honourable Captain Stewart, commanding the 9th grenadiers, and a
party of seamen under Lieutenant Wolley,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
marched from Grozier to attack St. Ann's Fort, a strong post about
twelve or fourteen miles to windward. After a most fatiguing march,
during which some heavy showers of rain rendered the roads hardly
passable, they reached the foot of the hill on which the fort was
situated; up which our people scrambled so leisurely, and such a
profound silence reigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
among them, that they approached within fifteen or twenty paces of the
centinel before he perceived them, though he was apparently alert on his
post. Our French guide was now so terrified that he fired his pistol at
the centinel, which gave the alarm; instantly our troops turned forward,
and with three cheers began to storm the works. The enemy were
completely surprised, and not more than two of them escaped. During this
the French emigrants who had accompanied our people, had marched into
the town, where they began the most brutal excesses; but the humane
exertions of our officers soon put a stop to their mischievous
proceedings. In this attack near four hundred of the enemy were killed,
and one prisoner taken: on our part one only was wounded. Several sloops
and schooners were found in the bay, all in ballast and their sails
unbent, except one of them, in which Lieutenant Thomson was sent with an
account of their success to the Commanders in Chief. It being impossible
to keep possession of this post, from the small number of our troops,
and intelligence being brought that a large detachment of the enemy were
on their march to cut off the retreat of this party, it was determined
to return to the camp without loss of time, all the ammunition having
been previously destroyed, and the guns of the fort
dismounted.&mdash;The day proving unusually hot, and the roads being
deep and slippery from the incessant rains that had fallen during the
preceding night, the troops were not able to reach the camp without
halting; in consequence of which they took post at a planter's house on
an eminence, where they were received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
with great hospitality. By three in the afternoon the men who had
dropped down by the way from fatigue, were brought in (except two who
reached the camp next morning), and the party proceeded to their
different stations without further accidents.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>On Tuesday the 24th of June, General Grey opened his batteries, which he
had erected near Grozier, against Fleur d'Epée; at the same time
Brigadier General Dundas kept up a smart fire on Point à Pitre, where
the enemy seemed to be making preparations against the hurricane months,
now approaching, by stripping the ships in the harbour of their sails
and rigging. On the 26th, early in the morning, the enemy, to the number
of three hundred, made a sortie from Fleur d'Epée, on our advanced post,
consisting of one hundred men, but were soon obliged to retreat; we lost
one man killed and eight wounded: at the same time our batteries and
gun-boats cannonaded the fort;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
in the latter two seamen were wounded. On the 27th, the batteries at
Grozier having opened as usual on Fleur d'Epée, a detachment of our
troops under Brigadier General Fisher marched forward to attack a piquet
of the enemy posted on Morne Mascot, from whence they drove them after a
sharp contest, and established themselves, as our advanced post, within
musket shot of the fort.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
During the preceding night the light infantry at camp Berville were sent
by Brigadier General Dundas, under command of Major Ross of the 25th
regiment, to Petit Bourg, where they embarked, and joined the army at
Grozier. This movement, by which the main body was much strengthened,
was effected unperceived by the enemy, and the 39th and 43d regiments
only left at Berville.</p>

<p>Several skirmishes now daily took place, and many fell on both sides;
though, from want of steadiness at the last, the enemy were always
greater losers than ourselves. On the morning of the 29th of June, a
large body of the enemy, to the number of one thousand, marched out of
Fort Fleur d'Epée, and seemed to meditate an attack on a detachment of
light infantry under Colonel Gomm, posted to the right of the grenadiers
who were on Morne Mascot, under Brigadier General Fisher. By this
false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
movement, they hoped that a detachment of the grenadiers would be sent
to reinforce the light infantry, and thereby weaken the force on Morne
Mascot, which was their real object of attack. In a short time, however,
they were perceived mounting the side of Mascot heights, with colours
flying and singing the national songs, covered by a heavy fire of round
and grape-shot from Fleur d'Epée, which prevented our grenadiers from
shewing themselves till the enemy were close to them; on which General
Fisher made them prostrate themselves on the ground, and wait the
approach of the enemy in that posture. The instant the republicans came
within a few yards of them they started up, and an obstinate engagement
commenced, which terminated at length by the grenadiers advancing to the
charge; on which the enemy fled, and were pursued down the hill with
great slaughter. Our loss amounted to thirty killed and wounded: among
the former was Lieutenant Toosey of the 65th regiment; of the latter,
Captain De Rivigne of the artillery, received a ball in the side of his
neck. Brigadier General Fisher was hit three times by grape-shot, which
caused contusions only, and his horse was killed under him. In the
evening the enemy sent in a flag of truce, requesting permission to bury
their dead and carry off their wounded, which was granted them;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
yet they left a number of both, on the side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
hill, to the great annoyance of our piquet, which during the following
night was disturbed by the groans of the dying and wounded. The day
following the enemy again made an attempt, in equal force, against our
post on Mascot, and was again repulsed with great loss. The rainy season
being already set in, and the hurricane months now approaching,
determined the Commander in Chief to make an effort to finish the
campaign at once. From his success in the two last engagements, and the
excellent manner in which he had planned the attack, it would no doubt
have succeeded, had his orders been punctually obeyed. The plan he had
laid down was, for a large body of troops under General Symes, to march
during the night, and make themselves masters of Morne Government, and
the other commanding heights round the town of Point à Pitre, whilst
himself, at the head of the rest of his army, was in readiness on the
heights of Mascot to storm Fort Fleur d'Epée, on receiving a signal from
General Symes; but, from some unfortunate misapprehension, the whole of
General Grey's well-concerted plan was rendered abortive, and the almost
total destruction of our exhausted forces ensued: but it is my business
to detail the events of this unfortunate affair as accurately as the
confused accounts I have received will permit. Brigadier General Symes,
having under his command the first battalion of grenadiers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
commanded by Brigadier General Fisher, and the first and second light
infantry, led by Colonel Gomm, with a detachment of seamen from the
Boyne<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
and Veteran, commanded by Captain Robertson of the Veteran, marched from
the heights of Mascot at about nine o'clock at night, on the 1st of
July. They first descended into a deep ravine thick planted with coffee
bushes, through which there was no road, the seamen bringing up the
rear. The night was uncommonly dark, which rendered their march both
dangerous and fatiguing. After proceeding about a mile they halted on a
road, and were joined by two small field-pieces, which were put under
the charge of Lieutenants Thomson and Maitland, to be dragged by their
seamen. During the halt some people, who were heard to speak French,
were seen near the rear; Lieutenant Wolley endeavoured to secure them,
but they escaped through the bushes, and no further notice was taken of
this. The army moved forward about two miles further, on a road leading
through deep ravines, and made a second halt for about an hour; the
march was then re-commenced, but no orders ever passed during the time:
they now proceeded for some miles without meeting with any obstruction,
when an order came for the seamen in the rear to advance to the attack,
which they did by running as fast as they could for upwards of a mile.
The parties they passed were not in the best order, owing to the
quickness of the march, until they came to the grenadiers, who
were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
drawn up as a corps de reserve. About this time the bugle horn sounded
to advance, and soon after a heavy firing of round and grape-shot from
Morne Government, and also from several other batteries of the enemy,
commenced, as also from some twelve-pounders landed from the shipping in
the harbour, which were placed in tiers, and entirely enfiladed the road
along which the troops were advancing. After passing the grenadiers, the
seamen were halted for a few minutes to form, they being perfectly out
of order from running; but scarce thirty of them were got together, when
Lieutenant Wolley was ordered to advance with them, and Captain
Robertson remained to form and bring up the rest. The cannonading from
the enemy's guns was the most severe the oldest soldier ever witnessed,
especially from the guns which were on the road; two or three tiers of
which were planted behind each other, from which the enemy were driven
by the bayonets of our gallant fellows, who no sooner had taken one
battery, but another opened on them from behind. The whole now became a
scene of confusion impossible to describe. Instead of any of the heights
being attempted, the greater part of the troops and the seamen were got
into the town, where they were mowed down by the grape-shot, which
played upon them in every direction,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
as well as musketry from the windows of the houses. Where-ever our men
perceived this, they broke open the doors, putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
all they found in them to death; and those who could not stand the
bayonet were shot as they leaped from the windows. General Symes was by
this time badly wounded,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
and his horse killed under him. Colonel Gomm (who led the light
infantry), with several other officers, was killed, and a great many
more desperately wounded;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
and Captain Robertson, who commanded the seamen, was blown up. At length
General Fisher (the second in command, who, as well as every other
officer on this service, was ignorant of General Symes's plans) sounded
a retreat, and the miserable remains of this gallant party marched off,
the enemy harassing them in their retreat, though kept at bay by the
gallant exertions of the Honourable Captain Stewart with a party of
grenadiers, assisted by Lieutenant Wolley and the seamen of the Boyne,
who covered the retreat; till at length the latter fell by a musket-ball
through his leg, and was brought off by his men. When the remains of
this unfortunate detachment got back to Mascot,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
General Grey found it in vain to attempt any thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
against Fleur d'Epée, being obliged to detach the second battalion of
grenadiers to cover the retreat, and his troops being all so much
reduced and exhausted, yet from the effect of the batteries he had
erected to cover his attack of Fleur d'Epée, which opened on that fort
in the evening, there could have been no doubt of success had not the
above-related misfortune taken place.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
It being totally impossible to attempt any thing further at this season,
the General that night began to reimbark his cannon and mortars, and in
two days had got off the whole of his troops without loss; he then
strengthened the posts on Basse Terre, and having made the best
arrangements possible to maintain them, and to enable him to renew his
attacks on Point à Pitre and Fleur d'Epée after the hurricane months, in
case any reinforcements should arrive (without which it would be totally
impossible), he embarked on board the Boyne, leaving Brigadier General
Colin Graham to command on Basse Terre, and then repaired to St. Pierre
in the island of Martinique, where he established his head-quarters. The
Boyne proceeded to Fort Royal Bay, where she was laid up for the
hurricane months in a snug harbour, called Trois Islet Bay, and the sick
and wounded were landed for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
benefit of fresh air, and every attention paid to them that could
alleviate their sufferings.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Grey, after giving the necessary orders for erecting
batteries to protect and secure the camp on Basse Terre, sailed with the
Admiral to Martinique, and established his head-quarters at St.
Pierre;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
having previously distributed the troops (which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
were not left under General Graham on Basse Terre) throughout the
islands, where the Brigands began to be very troublesome; and even at
Martinique, where the Commander in Chief resided, they had the audacity
to shew themselves, encouraged by the sickness which raged in all
quarters, and daily weakened our posts. At Grande Rivere and Calabass
they appeared in some force; on which the Commander in Chief detached
Captain Hare, at the head of a detachment of the Prince of Wales's
light<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
dragoons, with Lieutenant Colonel De Soter and the island rangers, who
attacked and routed them, taking three of their leaders prisoners, and
dispersing the rest. At Guadaloupe no time was lost by Brigadier General
Graham in preparing both for attack and defence; he erected gun and
mortar batteries upon the banks of the river Sallée, in the different
situations where it was most likely the enemy might attempt to cross it
from Grande Terre; namely, at the gabarre or ferry, which heretofore was
the point of communication between the two parts of the island; at Morne
Savon and at St. Jean, both commanding the town of Point à Pitre and
Morne Government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
By these precautions the Commander in Chief hoped to prevent the enemy
from crossing into Basse Terre till he could get a reinforcement from
England, which he had expected for some time, and had now dispatched
Brigadier General Francis Dundas to explain to government the absolute
necessity there was for a supply of troops in the conquered islands. The
head-quarters of the army in Guadaloupe were at Camp Berville, a very
commanding ground, flanked by the sea on one side, and on the other by
an impassable swamp and wood; about a league in front was the river
Sallée, on the opposite banks of which stood the town of Point à Pitre;
and at the rear, about a mile from the camp, was a narrow pass, by which
alone it could be approached. The batteries under the direction of
Captain De Rivigne, destroyed a great part of the town, so that the
inhabitants were obliged to evacuate it, and encamp on the adjacent
hills. The baneful effects of the climate, together with the
neighbouring swamps, began now to be severely felt by our army, the
officers and men died daily in numbers, and by the middle of August the
list of sick and convalescents composed by far the majority in the camp.
Two frigates and two sloops of war were ordered by the Admiral to cruize
off the harbour of Point à Pitre, to prevent supplies being carried to
the enemy; notwithstanding which many American and other vessels from
the neighbouring disaffected islands, contrived to elude their
vigilance. Victor Hughes, the commissioner from the French convention,
and now commander in chief of their troops in this island (the
commanders of the army and navy that came out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
with him being dead), was indefatigable in gaining over the blacks and
mulattoes to his interest; and, in consequence of his late success, they
flocked in great numbers to his standard. As they came in he formed them
into different corps, and had them instructed in the use of arms. The
remains of the second battalion of grenadiers<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
were ordered about the latter end of August to Guadaloupe, to relieve
the flank companies of the 15th and 64th regiments: they embarked at
Fort Royal on board the Dictator, and landed at Petit Bourg, from whence
they marched directly to the camp. During the month of September the
troops in the different camps were, from sickness, inadequate to furnish
guards for the different batteries. Several companies could not produce
a single man fit for duty; the 43d could not afford a corporal and three
men at night, for the protection of their own camp, much less give their
complement for the batteries. The greater part of the town of Petit
Bourg was converted into hospitals for our sick, besides great numbers
ill in the camps; the officers were equal sufferers with the men, so
much so, that field officers were obliged to mount captain's guard. The
different islands were drained of their troops, in order to keep up some
appearance in front of the enemy; and the royalists had taken the duty
of the Gabarre for some time past, where they conducted themselves with
much spirit in several attacks made upon them by the enemy from the
opposite side of the river. The grenadiers that arrived last, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
now reduced, in less than three weeks, to twenty men; and from the
situation of the several camps on the verge of the swamps, a ground they
were obliged to occupy, was truly deplorable. About this time General
Prescott arrived at the town of Basse Terre, where he took the command,
and no appearance of any reinforcement from England as yet cheered our
drooping spirits. On Saturday, the 26th of September, the enemy from
Point à Pitre and Fort Louis embarked a large body of troops in small
vessels, and passing our ships of war unperceived, under cover of the
dark night, effected two different landings on Basse Terre; the one at
Goyave, to the eastward of Petit Bourg, and the other at Lamantin, near
Bay Mahault. As soon as it was known that this landing was effected,
most of our sick were carried from Petit Bourg on board the ships that
lay near that place, and when the news was received at head-quarters,
General Graham ordered all the troops from the different camps to join
at Berville, as the strongest situation. Every exertion was made to
fortify this post in the best manner possible: across the narrow pass by
which alone it could be approached by land, a strong breast-work was
thrown up, with embrasures for six field-pieces; on the flanks, and
immediately in the rear of this, another was thrown up; and in front of
both, on the brow of the hill, a strong abbatis was formed. The enemy
that landed at Bay Mahault soon possessed themselves of that place; they
then marched on to the Gabarre, where they had nearly surrounded the
royalists before they were able to make their retreat to the camp. The
possession of the Gabarre afforded them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
an easy conveyance for guns, ammunition, cattle, &amp;c. from Grande
Terre, and they now made their appearance in sight of our camp. The
enemy, who had landed on the opposite part of the island, as soon as day
broke upon them, began their march to Petit Bourg. Lieutenant Colonel
Drummond of the 43d regiment, with some convalescents from the hospital,
and a party of royalists, advanced to meet them; but perceiving their
great superiority of numbers, found it advisable to retreat through
Petit Bourg, and took post at a battery upon the shore called Point
Bacchus, between that village and Camp Berville. The enemy, on taking
possession of Petit Bourg, exercised the most unheard of cruelties on
the unfortunate sick in the hospitals, putting all they found to death;
some of them were fortunate enough to be taken off by the boats
belonging to the men of war lying there. Too much praise cannot be given
to Captain Boyer<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
of the Assurance, for his humane exertions on this occasion. From the
hospitals to the wharf was a continued scene of misery and horror, being
strewed with the bodies of the sick, who were barbarously put to death
as they were crawling to the shore, in hopes of being taken off by our
boats. The next movement of the enemy was to Point Bacchus, where
Colonel Drummond and his party, being surrounded, were made prisoners.
The enemy keeping possession of this post, entirely cut off all
communication between the camp and our shipping. They then proceeded to
possess themselves of the surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
heights, and formed a junction with the other party which landed at Bay
Mahault; by which Camp Berville was completely surrounded on the land
side. The utmost strength of Berville camp was now about two hundred and
fifty regular troops, and three hundred royalists; but none of these
could be called effective, being reduced to extremity by sickness and
fatigue. The enemy instantly began to form batteries, one of which, on
an eminence, in some measure commanded our camp. On the 29th of
September, in the morning, the enemy in a large body attacked our
advanced work; our field-pieces and musketry opened a heavy fire upon
them, and an engagement ensued, which continued with equal fury for
three hours; when, after having been charged the third time by our
troops, the enemy retreated, leaving on the field in killed and wounded
seven hundred men, our loss amounting to about twenty. In the forenoon
of this day, the enemy had sent a number of gun-boats from Point à
Pitre, some of which anchored off the shore at Berville, and others
under Point Bacchus, with a view to stop the communication between our
camp and shipping, and force the latter out of the harbour of Petit
Bourg. Each of their schemes succeeded, so that now the camp (ill
supplied with provisions and stores, which were left chiefly at Petit
Bourg) saw no possibility of getting a further supply. This morning
Major Irvine was killed by a twenty-four pounder from the enemy's
gun-boat, as he was sitting in the cabin of the Assurance; in which he
and a number of others had embarked. As soon as the news of these
disasters reached the Commanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
in Chief, the Boyne was got out of Trois Islet Bay, without loss of
time; and, although the hurricane season was not entirely past, the
Admiral embarked, and sailed on Tuesday, the 30th of September, from
Martinique, and anchored off Grozier, in the bay of Point à Pitre, by 10
A.M. On Thursday, the 2d of October, the two-gun battery there, opened
upon us with red-hot shot, and continued to fire for a considerable
time, but without effect. This night the Admiral endeavoured to open a
communication with Camp Berville, but was prevented by the vigilance of
the enemy, who now occupied every avenue to it. On the morning of the
30th, the enemy renewed their attacks on General Graham's camp at
Berville, and again on the 4th of October, still bringing (hydra like)
greater numbers to the charge; their success, however, was the same as
on the first attack, having lost during the three attacks, on a moderate
computation, two thousand men. In the second attack General Graham was
wounded by a musket-ball in the leg, and several of his officers fell.<a
name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
After the third action the enemy sent in a flag of truce, offering terms
of capitulation, which General Graham in a spirited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
manner refused; the officers, however, waited on the General, and
stated, that the troops, reduced by sickness and fatigue, were no longer
able to undergo the duty, which now pressed heavy on them, and were so
harassed as to be incapable of withstanding another attack, which the
enemy promised to make on them the following morning. General Graham
therefore, reconsidering the matter, consented to send a flag to the
enemy, and, after some time, the terms of capitulation were agreed to;
but, alas! the unfortunate royalists were not included, though the
General endeavoured all he could to make terms for them: he succeeded
however thus far, to have permission to send a covered boat to the
Boyne, in which he embarked twenty-five officers of the royalists; their
unfortunate brethren, to the number of three hundred, who had defended
their posts to the last, with the most determined resolution, were
doomed to suffer death by the hands of their republican countrymen in
cold blood, in a manner hitherto, I believe, unheard of, at least
unrecorded in the annals of the most savage and abandoned people.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Humanity must shudder at the idea; the republicans erected a guillotine,
with which they struck off the heads of fifty of them. Thinking,
however, this mode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of proceeding too tedious, they invented a more summary plan; they tied
the remainder of these unhappy men fast together, and placed them on the
brink of the trenches which they had so gallantly defended; they then
drew up some of their undisciplined recruits in front, who firing an
irregular volley at their miserable victims, killed some, wounded
others, and some, in all probability, were untouched; the weight however
of the former dragged the rest into the ditch, where the living, the
wounded, and the dead, shared the same grave, the soil being instantly
thrown upon them. The English troops were to be allowed to march out
with the honours of war, and to be embarked on board French ships, which
were to sail for England within twenty-one days after the surrender,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
on condition that they would not serve against the French during the
war. A great quantity of arms and ammunition fell into the hands of the
enemy at this camp, and at Petit Bourg. Immediately after the surrender
of Berville, Victor Hughes moved towards the town of Basse Terre, now
our last stake on this island, laying waste the plantations, and burning
the beautiful seats of the royalists as he passed along. Sir John
Jervis, who had made every attempt to succour General Graham's camp at
Berville, and had been an unwilling spectator from the fleet, of the
surrender of that camp to the enemy, now made sail for Basse Terre, to
render every assistance in his power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
General Prescott;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
and on the 9th of October, anchored within half a cable's length of the
town. General Prescott instantly came on board to consult with the
Admiral on the best mode of procedure in this critical state of affairs;
and it was determined that the whole force which the General could
collect, should go into the fort, and the Admiral, in the Boyne, would
render every assistance in his power to the garrison; a promise he
performed in a manner that drew the warmest thanks and approbation of
General Prescott and his officers. At this time the French royalists had
entirely abandoned us, and the militia, who had demanded arms,
positively refused to enter the fort, and soon after deserted to the
enemy: a party in the town seemed also ready to rise upon our people;
but by the vigilance and activity of General Prescott they were
overawed, and he continued to ride into the town unattended as usual.
The fort was in a miserable state, nothing having been done to it since
the peace of 1783; and Clairfontaine,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
a royalist, who had been appointed administrateur general, wanting
either influence or ability to procure negroes for the purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
the fort was no way better than when it fell into our hands, except
being cleaner, and supplied with provisions. On the 12th of October, a
schooner bearing a flag of truce, arrived from Victor Hughes; in it came
Captain Eiston, of the 35th regiment,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
for a supply of money and baggage for our captured countrymen, with
which he returned in two days to Point à Pitre. General Prescott had
taken the precaution to order all the batteries along the coast, as well
as those on the passes of the Palmiste, to be destroyed, their guns
spiked, and magazines blown up; but, owing to the shortness of the time
allowed for it, and the weakness of the force employed, the enemy soon
got them repaired to use against us. Captain Bowen, in the Terpsichore,
was dispatched to Trois Riviere, to destroy a battery there,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
where he saw and fired on the enemy, who were marching in great force
towards the heights of Palmiste. On which he returned, and informed the
Admiral of this, by whom the intelligence was instantly forwarded to
General Prescott, who had sent Captain Thomas of the 28th regiment (his
aid-de-camp) to request some seamen to reinforce his garrison, which
were most readily granted by the Admiral. While Captain Thomas was on
board the Boyne, the enemy, to his great astonishment, were seen on the
heights of Palmiste. As there were a few royalists about the General,
some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
of whose slaves were with the enemy, of course he ought to have received
earlier information of their approach; but this shews how all
intelligence was withheld from us. For ten days after the General had
withdrawn the whole of his force into the fort, he occasionally sent
parties into the town, as the Boyne still kept the enemy quiet there;
but in a short time they got some guns up to an eminence, named by us
the White-house Battery, that obliged the Admiral to weigh anchor: but
he still continued to hover about the coast, occasionally sending
reinforcements and provisions, and keeping up a constant intercourse
with General Prescott in the fort. In the course of this business the
Boyne was frequently engaged with the different batteries, and was
exposed to great danger from the mortars, which the enemy began to play
upon us with much judgment. On the 20th of October, the battery on
Houelmont opened on the Terpsichore, but without effect. Our garrison in
the fort threw some shells which drove them from thence; they, however,
soon returned again to their guns. The next day they again attacked the
frigate, and hit her; which obliged Captain Bowen to get near the land,
out of the direction of their guns. On the 23d, the White-house Battery,
having several heavy guns mounted, began a smart fire on the Boyne,
which was returned from her lower deckers; afterwards we engaged a
battery, into which the enemy had just come, at the N. W. end of the
town, from whence we drove them; but being obliged to haul off shore
occasionally, they at length completed their purpose, but not so as to
be able to hinder us from approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the land to keep up an intercourse with the garrison. On this service
(as on every other) Captain Bowen eminently distinguished himself,
having anchored the Terpsichore, within a short distance of the fort, in
a bay under Houelmont. On the 25th the Quebec, Captain Rogers, Beaulieu,
Captain Riou, and Zebra, Captain Vaughan, arrived from a cruise. The
enemy now increased their forces daily in this part of the island,
pressing into their service all the negroes who were on the different
estates; and if from timidity or any other cause they demurred, they
were instantly shot: from the ship we saw them firing on some negroes of
their own, who, from fear, were endeavouring to get off. On the night of
the 26th, Lieutenant James, with a party of seamen, marched out of the
fort to the military hospital, which he set on fire, being a place that
the enemy would soon have made a considerable post against us. On the
29th, the Boyne, as usual sailing towards the fort, was becalmed by the
high land of Houelmont, and being within a short distance, was
cannonaded from that battery for several hours. From the height of its
situation none of our guns could be brought to bear against it; however,
after considerable danger, the ship got out of the bay without any
damage. On the 5th of November, the enemy opened ten batteries against
the fort at the same instant, and a party of them, with a field-piece,
under cover of the night, had taken post on the brow of the hill under
which the Terpsichore and Experiment were anchored. As soon as the
seamen were arranged at day-break, to wash the decks as usual, they were
surprised by a heavy shower of musketry from over their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
heads. The Experiment endeavoured to get away, but being totally
becalmed, it was some time before she could accomplish it. (Captain
Miller had gone on board the Vanguard, and Captain Skynner was then in
the Boyne, receiving his commission.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>)
Captain Bowen, with a presence of mind that never forsook him, ordered
up all the muskets that could be procured, and, encouraging his men with
great spirit and some effect, returned the fire of the enemy, who now
brought their field-piece to bear on the ship; he was therefore obliged
to weigh anchor, and get out of the bay as well as he could, his great
guns being totally useless from the elevated situation of the enemy: two
or three only of our people were wounded, though the deck was studded
with musket-balls. The fort<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
was now closely invested by land; by the sea a communication was
continued the whole siege, Captain Bowen, in the Terpsichore, never
relaxing for a moment in his exertions to serve and assist the garrison.
The water in the tank being bad (the enemy having cut off the aqueduct
that supplied it), General Prescott ordered an armed party every morning
and evening to the river Galion, to protect those sent thither for
water. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
continued during the whole siege; cohorns and grape-shot being fired
into the ravines and woods beyond the river, and other precautions
taken, these parties met with little molestation. All the buildings in
the fort being destroyed by the fire of the enemy, the garrison was
obliged to take shelter in the Bomb-proof, a close and unwholesome
confinement in this climate. On the 6th of November, Victor Hughes sent
an insolent summons to General Prescott, to surrender the fort in two
hours, which if not complied with, no further terms would be offered,
and the whole garrison would be put to the sword. To this the General
made a short answer, "that he would defend it as a soldier to the last
extremity." The instant the hour was expired that the General allowed
the French officer to return to Victor Hughes, he opened a heavy fire
from all his batteries against the republicans, and continued it through
the day without any return from them. Some stores and provisions were
about this period sent to the garrison from Dominica, and the merchants
of St. Pierre also made a welcome present of refreshments; the enemy at
the same time began to supply their advanced batteries with necessaries
by sea in small boats, that, keeping close in shore, evaded our
cruisers, and landed at the town of Basse Terre. On the 12th of
November, the Boyne was exposed for some time to a heavy fire from
several batteries; one shell burst immediately over her, but without
doing any mischief. At nine A. M. on the 14th of November, the Beaulieu,
being then off Vieu Fort, made a signal to the Admiral, of an enemy of
superior force being in sight. Immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
all hands were ordered to quarters, and every preparation made to give
them a warm reception; at length three line-of-battle ships hove in
sight, which, to our great joy, proved to be a reinforcement from
England; the Majestic, Captain Westcott, with Vice Admiral Caldwell's
flag on board; the Theseus, Captain Calder; and Bellona, Captain Wilson:
by them we were informed that Sir John Vaughan had arrived at St.
Pierre, and Sir Charles Grey had given up the command to him. Sir John
Jervis, worn down by long and severe exertions, the fatigues of which
were augmented by his anxiety for the welfare of the service, that not
all his exertions could promote without the arrival of a strong
reinforcement, together with the unhealthiness of the climate, found
himself no longer able to continue on this station, and therefore, to
the great grief of General Prescott, was obliged to give up his command
to Admiral Caldwell, and embarking his seamen (under Lieutenant James)
from Fort Matilda, sailed for St. Pierre; when, every thing being
arranged and settled between the several commanders, Sir Charles Grey
and his suite embarked once more with Sir John Jervis on board the
Boyne; on the 27th of November they sailed for England, and after a
tedious voyage (being for near a month tossed about in the Channel by
contrary winds) arrived at Spithead the 21st of January 1795.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As we left General Prescott in a perilous situation, it may be proper to
give an account of the conclusion of the siege, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
it comes not within the original plan of my work, which professed only
to relate the events that took place under the immediate command of Sir
Charles Grey and Sir John Jervis. This I am enabled to do from the
communication of a brave and intelligent friend who was there during the
whole siege. On the 29th of November, Captain Cockburne, aid-de-camp of
General Sir John Vaughan, was sent by his Excellency to Fort Matilda,
with the unwelcome news that no more men could be sent thither. On the
5th of December, General Prescott dispatched Captain Thomas, his
aid-de-camp, to the Commander in Chief, with an account of the fort
being almost in ruins; this officer returned thither on the 7th, and
found that the bastion towards the river Galion was totally silenced,
and so completely commanded by the enemy's musketry, that not a man
could approach it; the adjoining curtain was much in the same state; the
bastion towards the town was giving way, and expected to tumble into the
ditch every moment. General Prescott no longer thought of defence, but
to secure his small garrison, now highly necessary for the defence of
the other islands, the unparalleled mortality having left them almost
without troops. The pestilential fever had been, in proportion, more
fatal to the officers than the men; in the garrison, for instance, there
was no officer of intermediate rank between the General and his
aid-de-camp Captain Thomas, who was second in command. On the 9th of
December, this officer was dispatched to Admiral Thompson, and after the
plan of embarkation was settled, he returned to the fort, and the
evacuation commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
at nine o'clock on the 10th of December, and was conducted with so much
skill, that not a man was lost. In the morning two of the garrison
deserted to the enemy; but the General had concealed his intentions so
well, that not the least intelligence of it seems to have been given by
them. There was no interruption to the retreat except a few musket-shots
on the beach, from one of which that active officer Captain Bowen was
badly wounded in the face. The enemy, unconscious of this movement,
cannonaded and bombarded the fort as usual, until two o'clock the next
morning, though the embarkation had been completed by eleven the
preceding night. The whole force that marched out of Fort Matilda, was
between four and five hundred: some of them were sent to the Isle de
Saintes and Antigua, and the remainder to Martinique. Thus concluded a
siege of eight weeks and two days, during the whole of which General
Prescott evinced the most perfect coolness and true soldierly
resolution, neither appalled by the tremendous and well-directed fire
constantly, both night and day, kept up against the fort, nor by the
insolent and threatening summonses of Victor Hughes.<a
name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
In the handsomest manner he bore testimony to the zeal and activity of
Sir John Jervis, who relaxed not in his attention to the wants of the
garrison, till he was obliged to quit the station; leaving however, in
Captain Bowen, a man whose existence seemed to be preserved, amidst the
greatest dangers, for the service of his country. Admiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Thompson had his share of praise too for the manner in which he had
conducted the embarkation. During the siege seventeen were killed, and
seventy-nine were wounded. General Prescott immediately repaired to
Saint Pierre, at Martinique, where he received the well-earned thanks
and congratulations of all ranks, for his spirited and gallant defence
of Fort Matilda. Victor Hughes,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
on taking possession of the fort, ordered the monument that had been
erected over General Dundas, to be destroyed, and his remains thrown
into the river Galion; a conduct as mean and brutal, as it was
undeserved. I cannot conclude without mentioning the death of that
gallant officer, Captain Faulknor, commanding the Blanche frigate of
thirty-two guns, who, on the 5th of January, fell in with the republican
frigate, La Pique of thirty-eight guns, off the harbour of Point à
Pitre; the action was maintained with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
greatest fury and obstinacy for five hours, during which Captain
Faulknor fell by a musket-ball as he was a second time lashing the
bowsprit of La Pique to the capstern of his own ship. The loss of this
brave man must be deplored by every friend to the service; his courage
and determined bravery had been often tried, and always with success, as
in the course of this work I have frequently had occasion to mention. On
his death the command devolved on the first lieutenant, Mr. Watkins, who
continued the action in a manner that did him immortal honour. The
French ship having lost her main and mizen sails, the Blanche took her
in tow, still continuing the engagement, when the stern ports not being
large enough, they blew the upper transom beam away, and fired into her
bows for three hours. The marines under Lieutenant Richardson, kept so
well directed a fire, that not a man could appear on her forecastle
until she struck; sixty-seven of her crew were dead on the decks; many
had been thrown overboard; one hundred and ten wounded were landed at
the Saintes; and one hundred and seventy-four were taken to Martinique.
The Blanche had ten killed, including the Captain, and twenty-four
wounded. Captain Faulknor's exertions in forwarding the service on every
occasion, both during, and since the campaign, were unremitting. Indeed
the English cause in the West Indies, at this instant, could hardly have
received a deeper wound than it did by the death of this brave and
zealous man.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="fr"><i>Head Quarters, Barbadoes, Wednesday, Jan. 22, 1794.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><span class="fl">Parole, <span class="smcap">St. Domingo</span>.</span><span class="smcap fr">C. S. Williamson.</span><br /></p>

<p>The Commander in Chief, having nearly finished all his arrangements to
open the campaign with vigour, thinks it necessary, during the few days
the troops remain at Barbadoes, to give out the orders proper for the
regulation and conduct of the troops; and he anxiously calls upon every
commanding officer of brigades, regiments, and corps, to support him in
the due and strict observance thereof. The object of the campaign is to
complete the conquest of the French West India Islands. Great
sufficiency of provisions and a numerous train of artillery are
provided. The General is so thoroughly convinced of the zeal and
intelligence of the officers and soldiers under his command, that he
knows many orders upon the present occasion are unnecessary; yet, to
shorten orders in future, it may not be improper to explain to the
soldiers the fatal consequences of straggling ever so little away from
camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A2" id="Page_A2">[Pg A2]</a></span>
in quest of plunder; it is next to a certainty they will fall ignobly by
the hands of the country people: or if they should escape, they may
depend upon suffering the severe punishment due to disobeying military
orders; as the General will never allow (while he has the honour to
command such troops) practices of that nature to gain ground, as that
alone, in time, will defeat the bravest army in the world, and render
all their efforts useless. The British soldiers cannot be ignorant of
the high reputation they have always acquired for obedience, attention,
and expertness, in arms; and consequently they must be sensible how much
their king and country expect from them: and the General is impressed
with every assurance, that the troops will not disappoint them upon this
occasion. The General takes the liberty to assure them, that they are
able to fight any troops upon earth; and he will be answerable that it
would not be a contest of ten minutes between this army and the best
troops of France, whether the affair was to be decided by fire or
bayonet. This last method is always to be preferred, but much more so
when acting against such bad troops as the army we are now to be opposed
to, the enemy being made up chiefly of negroes and mulattoes, with a
very small proportion of regular troops; to be beat by whom would be so
disgraceful, that he cannot entertain the most distant thought of it.
The present distracted state of France makes it impossible to support
them, therefore it only requires the usual perseverance and gallantry of
British soldiers to conquer the first island that an attack is made
upon, which will certainly decide the fate of the whole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A3" id="Page_A3">[Pg A3]</a></span>
shorten the campaign, and put an honourable end to the labour and
exertion of the troops. The General thinks it a duty incumbent on him,
and which he doubts not will be taken well, to point out further what he
thinks necessary, either for their own particular good, or that more
noble object, the good of their king and country. The General desires
the soldiers will consider what hardships must attend their profession;
that there is as much true honour in bearing them with manly fortitude,
as in forcing the cannon of an enemy; patience under difficulties being
one of the first virtues in a military character, and without which no
man, however brave, will ever be a soldier. In times like the present
some sacrifice of convenience must always be made to necessity; at the
same time the soldiers may be assured that every attention will be paid
by the Commander in Chief, and every other officer, to have them well
supplied with every article that the nature of the service will admit.
On the other hand, he hopes the soldiers will be so thoroughly convinced
of this, that not one of them will be so lost to honour and virtue, and
the service of their country, as not readily and most cheerfully to put
up with every inconvenience, and even to the scarcity of provisions, if
it should so happen. The General means to carry the business through
with as little loss as possible, and with the strictest attention to the
preservation of the troops: to this end he expects that every duty
required will be carried forward by the troops without the least
unsoldier-like behaviour or complaint, and that all orders will be
strictly obeyed. The army is sent to carry on honourable war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A4" id="Page_A4">[Pg A4]</a></span>
against the French colonies, and by their conduct, in preserving the
persons and properties of the peaceable inhabitants, to conciliate the
minds of the people to the British government; therefore the General
determinately assures the troops, that he will allow of no drunkenness
or licentious behaviour, no burning of churches, houses, or edifices of
any description, without orders, or plundering in any shape whatever.
All persons that with their property remain in their habitations, shall
be treated with humanity. No violence to be offered, particularly to
women, on any pretence whatever. The strictest subordination and
discipline to be preserved throughout the whole army; and the commanding
officer of brigades, regiments, and corps, must be responsible
accordingly to the Commander in Chief.&mdash;The commanding officer will
be careful that these orders, and every other that comes out, are
distinctly read to their men by an officer, and be clearly understood by
both officers and soldiers.&mdash;However it may hurt the General's
feelings, he is determined to make immediate examples of all those who
shall presume to disobey his orders; more particularly that part of them
relative to plundering, ill treatment of peaceable inhabitants, or
firing of houses, &amp;c. And Captain Vipond, provost marshal, has his
orders to execute upon the spot every offender caught in such horrid
acts, without trial.&mdash;It may be necessary here to acquaint all
officers' servants (not soldiers), and followers of the army of every
description, that they are subject to military law, and liable in like
manner with the troops to the punishment of death, or corporal
punishment, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A5" id="Page_A5">[Pg A5]</a></span>
the nature of the offence. Each regiment and corps will apprize them of
this, that ignorance may not be pleaded as an excuse. The success of
this army totally depends upon a proper and strict degree of order and
discipline being maintained; the General therefore again calls upon
officers of every rank to assist him in enforcing it; for the whole are
not to suffer by a disorderly few, who, if allowed to go on, would be
the destruction of the whole army.</p>

<p>The provost marshal's guard to mount to-morrow morning at six o'clock,
consisting of one sergeant, two corporals, twelve privates; and Captain
Vipond will direct patroles to go out as he judges necessary, for the
purpose of preserving order and regularity.&mdash;William Allen,
sergeant major, of the forty-eighth regiment, is appointed deputy to the
provost marshal; Captain Scott, of the sixth regiment, to act as major
to that regiment; and Quarter Master William Haugh to do the duty of
adjutant till further orders.&mdash;Carpenters are much wanted to
expedite the equipment of hospital ships, and other necessary work on
board the fleet; returns to be given in by each corps to-morrow of the
number of carpenters they have, and such as they can furnish; to be
supplied on the application of Captain Armstrong, assistant to the
quarter master general, who will receive and take care to return them on
board their respective transports. Working parties from the troops
afloat are necessary for the same purpose, and will be supplied in
rotation, by corps, with a proper proportion of non-commissioned
officers, on the application of Captain Armstrong to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A6" id="Page_A6">[Pg A6]</a></span>
officers commanding regiments or battalions. The sixth regiment, and
such of the flank companies not yet completed with camp equipage, will
receive it on board the Sincerity brig to-morrow morning at six o'clock.
The quarter masters of the respective battalions will attend to receive
it.&mdash;Lieutenant Geyer of the sixty-seventh regiment to do duty with
the sixth regiment.&mdash;Provost's guard, first battalion grenadiers.
One sergeant, nine privates of the ninth regiment on board the army brig
to be landed this evening, and to march to St. Ann's, where they are to
remain till further orders. The light companies at St. Ann's Castle will
fire ball this evening, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The safety of an army depending in a great measure upon the guards and
out-posts, they cannot be too vigilant; therefore the Commander in Chief
expects, that whatever post or guard an officer is ordered to take, he
will first visit his situation and ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A7" id="Page_A7">[Pg A7]</a></span>
around it, and post his centinels so as to render it out of the power of
the enemy to surprise him. It is the greatest disgrace that can possibly
befall an officer; and so much so in the General's opinion, that any
officer, or non-commissioned officer, who shall suffer himself to be
surprised, must not expect to be forgiven.&mdash;All out-posts to
fortify themselves as well as they can, to prevent any insult from
parties of the enemy. The troops always to form two deep; and, the roads
being so narrow in the island, it will be necessary for them to march by
files: if there is room to do otherwise, the commanding officer will be
the best judge.&mdash;The soldiers will bear in mind the use of the
bayonet, which in possession of, they can have no excuse for retreating
for want of ammunition, the bayonet being the best and most effectual
weapon in the hands of a gallant British soldier; in which mode of
attack (the General assures them) no troops upon earth are equal to
them. In case of a night attack, ammunition and firing are totally out
of the question, and the bayonet is ever to be preferred and made use
of. Every reason is in favour of this system; amongst many others the
following, viz. It conceals you and your numbers from the enemy; the
enemy direct their fire wherever they see or hear fire, consequently
fire upon each other, whilst you are concealed, and they fall an easy
prey. The General assures the troops of this from his own repeated
experience; and the soldiers may rely in confidence upon him, that if it
is strictly adhered to, it will seldom, if ever, fail of
success.&mdash;As it may be necessary at particular times to order the
grenadiers, light infantry, and advanced corps, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A8" id="Page_A8">[Pg A8]</a></span>
retire, in order more effectually to secure the defeat of the enemy, the
Commander in Chief thinks it necessary to apprize the army of this, to
prevent any alarm such an appearance might otherwise occasion amongst
the soldiers.&mdash;Weak and sickly men are not to embark with their
regiments or corps; proper measures will be taken to get those men to
their regiments as soon as they are in a state fit for duty. No women to
come on shore till particularly ordered, &amp;c.</p>

<p>William Milton, private in the detachment of British light dragoons, and
Samuel Price, a negro, attached to the dragoons, tried by a general
court martial, of which Lieutenant Colonel Bryan Blundell was president,
for having entered the house of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A11" id="Page_A11">[Pg A11]</a></span>
Jacques, an inhabitant of this place, and robbing him of a sum of money,
are both found guilty of the crime laid to their charge; and, by virtue
of the power and authority vested in the court by the fourth article of
the twenty-third section of the articles of war, the said prisoners,
William Milton and Samuel Price, are adjudged to suffer death; which is
approved of by the Commander in Chief, and the general court martial is
dissolved.</p>

<p>The Commander in Chief feels most sensibly, and laments the necessity of
making examples so immediately after landing, notwithstanding the
strongest and most pointed orders given by him so recently against every
kind of irregularity and improper behaviour in soldiers on service, but
particularly against this very crime committed by the prisoners.
Determined, however, to have his orders obeyed, to preserve discipline
in the army, which is so essential to its success, and to prevent a
repetition of crimes so base, disgraceful, and detestable, the
prisoners, William Milton and Samuel Price, are ordered to be executed
at eight o'clock to-morrow morning. The troops to parade at seven
o'clock to-morrow morning, in readiness to attend the execution. The
ninth and fifteenth regiments to send four men each in augmentation of
the castle guard in the rear of the head quarters. Six mules will be
delivered to each of the flank battalions, and four to each regiment, at
nine o'clock to-morrow morning, at the quarter master general's.</p>

<p>The Commander in Chief hopes the awful scene of this morning will have
its proper effect, and not lay him again under the most feeling and
painful necessity of repeating it, but which must certainly be the
unhappy case in the persons of future offenders. The General could not
be justified in the eyes of his king and country, and this army he has
the honour to command, in acting otherwise, their existence and success
depending (of which every good thinking soldier must be sensible) upon a
proper degree of discipline and subordination, with the most minute and
strictest obedience to orders, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The General has the pleasure to announce to the army the complete
success of Brigadier General Whyte, at the head of the third light
infantry, in gallantly storming and taking the batteries of Cape Solomon
and Bourgis. In Cape Solomon were four thirty-six pounders and two
twenty-four pounders; in Bourgis three twenty-four pounders, all in
perfect order to turn against the enemy; with powder and shot in
abundance. This success opens a near communication with the fleet, by
enabling them to come into Ance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A13" id="Page_A13">[Pg A13]</a></span>
d'Arlet Bay, with every supply the army may be in want of; and what
still renders it more valuable, carried with the loss only of one man.</p>

<p>The Commander in Chief has again the pleasure to announce to the troops
the further success of his majesty's arms towards the conquest of the
island of Martinico, by the able conduct of Major General Dundas, and
the gallantry and spirit of the troops under his command, in attacking
the enemy's troops under the command of Mons. Bellgarde at Trinité with
bayonets, and putting them totally to the rout with great slaughter, he
narrowly escaping with a few followers into Fort Royal. The Major
General with great spirit followed up the blow, and took possession of
the very strong fort of the Gros Morne, where the English colours are
now flying.</p>

<p>He has also the pleasure to add the gallantry of the seventieth
regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Johnston, and led by Colonel
Dundas, who with so much spirit and <span class="correction"

attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A14" id="Page_A14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the enemy posted upon Morne Charlotte Pied, and put them totally to
flight, taking possession of that important commanding ground looking
down upon Pigeon Island, which, when, attacked (in conjunction with
Brigadier General Whyte) and taken, will enable the English fleet to
come up into Fort Royal Harbour, in full view of the enemy's Forts of
Bourbon and Royal.</p>

<p>The Commander in Chief is happy in the opportunity of making honourable
mention of Captain Nares of the seventieth regiment, who led the
advanced guard with so much true courage and judgment in the above
attack, as reported to him in the strongest manner by Colonel Dundas.</p>

<p>It is with the utmost satisfaction the Commander in Chief announces to

morning about eleven o'clock, being a post of great strength, and of the
utmost importance towards the success of our future operations. The

commanded and conducted this service with such spirit and ability as to
do him honour. Likewise to Colonel Symes, quarter master general, for
his able assistance and zeal upon the occasion.&mdash;The Commander in
Chief returns his thanks to Lieutenant Colonel Close, who commanded the
third battalion of light infantry; and to Major Manningham, for his
conspicuous exertions. Likewise to Lieutenant Colonel Paterson and Major
Manly, who commanded the royal artillery, which was well and ably
served; and to Colonel Durnford of the engineers.</p>

The Commander in Chief also has to offer his warmest acknowledgments and

perseverance, able assistance, and good conduct, contributed much to the

Captain Pomier, in the attack of a very strong post of the enemy at
eleven o'clock last night, in which attack two hundred of the enemy were
surprised, and totally routed, with some loss, and all their cattle,
provisions, arms, &amp;c. and some prisoners taken, with the loss of one
man only of the fifteenth regiment killed, and two wounded.</p>

<p>The fifteenth regiment, at the same time that they accept the Commander
in Chief's acknowledgments for their spirited conduct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A17" id="Page_A17">[Pg A17]</a></span>
will allow him to say, that if they had not fired, the surprise might
have been more complete; and firing, he trusts, they will in future, in
all night attacks, on all occasions, avoid, and which, they well know,
how very strongly he recommended previous to the opening of the
campaign; and he desires the commanding officers will turn back to their
orders, and read them to the officers and men.</p>

<p>The Commander in Chief desires that the warm sense he entertains of the

<p>The Commander in Chief holds himself highly obliged to the troops for

and congratulates them upon so easy an acquisition of the strong ground
hitherto occupied by the enemy, owing to the prompt and spirited

<p>The Commander in Chief saw with pleasure and surprise this morning the
great progress that has been made in forming an excellent road for the
battering train through so difficult a country, and the fair prospect of
the artillery shortly arriving at the destined ground. Nothing can
exceed the order and indefatigability of the British sailors, and the
zeal and pleasure with which they appear animated in the most laborious
exertions; he has remarked this with the utmost satisfaction.</p>

<p>He begs Captains Hervey, Kelly, and Carpenter, with the officers and men
under their command, will accept his best thanks and acknowledgments of
how much he owes them. When the two services thus combine and
co-operate, the greatest obstacles may be surmounted, and every
difficulty vanish. The Commander in Chief has given orders to the

<p>Not that the Commander in Chief has any reason whatever to suspect the
advanced posts and guard of the camp are not alert, but, on the
contrary, their steadiness and attention give him true satisfaction:
nevertheless he thinks it right to warn them, that the enemy, in their
present hopeless situation, may be desperate, and attempt to insult some
of the posts: more they cannot do; but the slightest advantage gained,
their expiring cause may for a moment be spirited up to hold out a
little longer, and cause the loss of a few brave men; this the Commander
in Chief wishes to avoid, and to make the conquest of this valuable
island of Martinico with the least loss possible, he being ever
attentive and watchful of their preservation. He particularly desires
the advanced posts will, if possible, increase their vigilance, and in
case of an insult, to meet it coolly, not risking themselves by darting
forward (this not being the time for such exertion), but to check their
ardour, and content themselves by standing on the defensive, and
repulsing the enemy, covering steadily the bringing up the battering
train to their destined ground, which will very soon be completed, and
the batteries ready to open powerfully upon the enemy from three points
at one and the same time; which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A22" id="Page_A22">[Pg A22]</a></span>
done, the Commander in Chief assures the army that he has every reason
to believe they will be in possession of the enemy's last stake in a
little time, and honourably put an end to their labours.</p>

<p>The Commander in Chief again repeats his orders for all the out-posts
that are the least exposed to the enemy's fire, to fortify and shelter
themselves, throwing up blinds at certain distances to run behind when a
shell falls, and which will effectually secure them.&mdash;In the trench
of Lieutenant Colonel Coote's post three or four cross blinds should be
made; and the engineer is immediately to order it. The advanced guns
also to be guarded, to prevent a shot damaging a wheel or carriage;
which Lieutenant Colonel Paterson will order to be done.</p>

the sixty-fourth regiment. The court, having maturely considered the
evidence in support of the charge against the prisoners, together with
what they had to advance in their defence, acquit the prisoners,
Alexander Ross, second gunner of royal artillery, and Edward Brookes, of
the royal Irish artillery, of the charge against them of having robbed
Madame Lamalle and the washerwoman: but the prisoners, Alexander Ross,
of the royal artillery, and Edward Brookes, of the royal Irish
artillery, are both found guilty of absenting themselves from the post
of Gros Morne without leave, in breach of the fourteenth section of
articles of war, and are therefore adjudged to receive four hundred
lashes each on their bare backs.&mdash;The Commander in Chief approves
of the above sentence, and directs, that the punishment of four hundred
lashes each be inflicted on the prisoners to-morrow morning at seven
o'clock, at the head of the English and royal Irish artillery.&mdash;The
Commander in Chief is clearly of opinion that the prisoners, Alexander
Ross and Edward Brookes, were also guilty of the charge of robbery
advanced against them; but the evidence not being of that force to
justify the court martial in finding them guilty, they are fortunate in
escaping, and he thinks it will make a lasting impression on their
minds; for the Commander in Chief assures them, had they been found
guilty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A24" id="Page_A24">[Pg A24]</a></span>
(however painful to him), they should have suffered the last punishment,
death, at the head of the army.</p>

<p>The prisoner Phelps, soldier in the fortieth regiment of foot, tried by
the same general court martial for desertion, is found guilty, in breach
of the first article of the sixth section of the articles of war, and
sentenced to receive eight hundred lashes on his bare back, in the usual
manner. The Commander in Chief approves of the above sentence; but, in
consideration of the great length of time the prisoner, John Phelps, has
been confined, he is pleased to pardon him; and hopes this instance of
lenity will make a deep and lasting impression on his mind, and induce
him to behave like a good and faithful British soldier to his king and
country in future.</p>

of the enemy near Francois, which they had set on fire. The enemy were
completely surprised, who had been burning, plundering, and murdering,
wherever they went; thirty-six were killed, with their chief, who was
cut down by a light dragoon. Four prisoners were taken, who were hung up
as an example to such rascals in future; which method the General is

shot and musquetry from the garrison, taking the captain, lieutenant,

some of the guns of the Gabarre against the fort, merits the highest
praise and admiration. This gallant transaction the Commander in Chief
was a witness of, and takes this opportunity of repeating how perfectly

general, and of their unwearied exertion in forwarding his majesty's

<p>The Commander in Chief has great satisfaction in congratulating the army
on the most important capture of Fort Royal, effected with so much good
conduct and gallantry, which he trusts must lead to a speedy surrender
of Fort Bourbon.&mdash;The first battalion of grenadiers, commanded by
Lieutenant Colonel Stewart, and third battalion of light infantry,
commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Close, from camp la Coste, with the
third battalion of grenadiers, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel
Buckridge, and first light infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel
Coote, from the camp of Sourier, behaved with their usual spirit on the
occasion, and such as must always command success. Captain de Rivigne,
of the royal artillery, has done his duty in so excellent a manner,
shewing superior judgment in conducting the fire of the field pieces on
the left, and so effectually covering the approach of the troops, as has
done him the greatest honour, and proves him to be a most valuable
officer.</p>

<p>The Commander in Chief acknowledges great obligations to the navy, on
their gallant escalade of Fort Royal, under the able conduct of
Commodore Thompson, with the assistance of the Asia, Captain Brown; but
particularly to Captain Faulkner of the Zebra, whose gallantry and
judgment have justly gained him the admiration of the whole
army.&mdash;Commodore Thompson's judicious arrangement of the gun-boats

success of the enterprise, in which the zealous assistance and activity

that service, which he gives with infinite pleasure and satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Commander in Chief feels with great concern the necessity of again
assembling part of the troops to dislodge an enemy who have stolen into
Pointe a Pitre, and the posts in its neighbourhood, at the moment when
the gallant General Dundas was expiring. He had hoped that the troops,
whose meritorious services had acquired so much glory during a most
successful campaign, would have found rest and comfort during the
remainder of this year at least. Relying however on the cheerful and
utmost exertions of the gallant troops he has the happiness to command,
he cannot entertain a doubt of finishing the service speedily and
gloriously, to enable the troops to return very soon to the quarters
from whence they are now called forth to service.</p>

<p>The Commander in Chief assures the troops that their situation on this
extra service shall be made as comfortable and agreeable to them as it
is in his power to render it; and that no time shall be lost in
advancing against the enemy, consistent with the attention he always
pays to the preservation of his soldiers, not wantonly or prematurely
exposing them to danger.</p>

<p>The same conduct, good behaviour, and cool bravery, which gained such
rapid and complete success hitherto, will insure it on the present
occasion, against about five hundred regular troops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A35" id="Page_A35">[Pg A35]</a></span>
joined by a despicable and motley crew of mulattoes and negroes, with
some seamen, the whole a forlorn hope, who put in here for the want of
provisions, and at a time the forty-third regiment was weakened by
sickness.</p>

<p>The troops to be ready to get into the flat boats to-morrow morning at
three o'clock. The boats, when the men are embarked, are to assemble

provisions dressed, one day's grog, and rum in kegs for another day:
also to land with their tent blankets, camp kettles, water kegs,
canteens, and hand hatchets; the sailors to land with ditto and
tomahawks.</p>

<p>The sixty-fifth regiment then to land with two six-pounders; Captain de
Rivignes commanding the artillery. After the troops are landed, and have
got the heights opposite, the spare artillery, howitzers, stores,
&amp;c. are to be landed at Grozier. The commanding engineer will land
at the same time all the artificers, and every thing belonging to his
department, that no time whatsoever may be lost in forwarding the
enterprise. The first troops that land will immediately take advantage
of the strongest ground, houses, &amp;c. there posting themselves; not
advancing until the whole are landed. Brigadier General Symes will
direct the landing, and is to command the troops on shore. The Commander
in Chief has been pleased to appoint Captain John Cunnyngham, of

<p>The Commander in Chief is much surprised to find, from the report of
Brigadier General Symes, that the seamen and soldiers straggle from camp
in search of water, which, when found in the neighbourhood, is not fit
for drinking, though it may answer for cooking. The Commander in Chief
forbids any officer from quitting the post of his company, except on
duty; and directs that the rolls be called every two hours. If any
soldier or seaman be found marauding or straggling from camp, he will be
punished in the most severe manner. The officers commanding corps to see
their battalions fall in, and the rolls called, from which no officer is

<p>On account of the brilliant success of his majesty's arms, and his
allies, in France, by the complete victory gained by the Duke of York at
the head of the British, and also by the Austrians, on the 26th of April
last, in which the French General Chapuey was made prisoner, with
fifty-seven pieces of their cannon taken, and a great slaughter of their
troops, with a very inconsiderable loss of the British troops and their
allies, the Commander in Chief orders a <i>feu de joie</i> on the occasion at
six o'clock this evening; for which purpose all the troops will be under
arms and assemble with the naval battalion at five o'clock, and are to
be marched to a conspicuous situation, in view of the enemy, to give
three rounds of running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A38" id="Page_A38">[Pg A38]</a></span>
fire. The whole of our artillery, drawn up in front of the line, are to
fire three rounds. Each round of artillery to precede a round of small
arms: running fire beginning at the right of the line; and to conclude
with three hearty cheers.&mdash;Brigadier General Symes, who commands
the line, will be so good as to place and arrange the troops on this
occasion, pointing out the ground they are to assemble upon. The whole
navy will fire a <i>feu de joie</i>, and the troops under the command of
Brigadier General Dundas at the camp at Berville, at the same time.</p>

<p>The Commander in Chief desires that his long, spirited, and determined
orders, given out when the army sailed from Barbadoes on the expedition
to Martinico, dated the 22d of January, may be read to the troops,
particularly to the seamen, many of whom have not served on shore. This
the commanding officers of corps and naval battalions will be answerable
to the Commander in Chief is done; and at the same time to assure their
men, that however it may hurt his feelings, he will put the said orders
in full force upon any and every offender in future; for without strict
discipline and good order, no good service can possibly be effected: and
he again calls upon every officer in the army to assist him in this
necessary work. The troops to receive one day's fresh meat, and two days
salt provision and rum, to-morrow morning at day-break. Returns to be

or seaman, shall presume to take any negroes, except those delivered to
them by the quarter master general's department. The marauding which has
taken place obliges the General to remind the commanding officers of
corps to refer to orders already given out on that head. It will give
him extreme concern to be obliged to punish with severity such crimes;
but as the existence of the army depends on its discipline, it must be

<p>The Commander in Chief orders a <i>feu de joie</i> to be fired this evening
at six o'clock, to celebrate the most signal victory that ever was
gained over the French fleet, on the 1st of June last, by Earl Howe, in
the English channel. The French fleet consisted of twenty-six ships of
the line, the English fleet of twenty-five. Of the French seven sail of
ships of the line were taken, one sunk, and many of them dismasted and
crippled; so that most probably many more would fall into the hands of
the English. In short, the General has the satisfaction to announce to
the army the total ruin of the French fleet.</p>

<p>The recent act of inhumanity and barbarity committed at Guadaloupe by
the enemy (by whom a considerable number of royalists were murdered in
cold blood, after having fallen into their hands at Berville camp as
prisoners of war, and who had become subjects of Great Britain, by
taking the oath of allegiance to the British government, after the
conquest of that island), calls aloud for the following order and
declaration of the Commander in Chief: That all persons residing in the
conquered islands of Martinico, Guadaloupe, and St. Lucia, and their
dependencies, whether French or of any other nation, having taken the
oath of allegiance to the government of Great Britain, and who demean
and conduct themselves accordingly, shall receive every protection that
the other subjects of Great Britain do in these islands: and should such
cases of extremity happen as may render a capitulation necessary, no
terms are to be proposed or accepted, which do not give equal security,
safety, and protection, to them as to the other subjects of Great
Britain, as well those with arms as those without; consequently, no
place is to be surrendered before this is expressly and explicitly
acknowledged and subscribed to by the enemy, that in any extremity we
may stand or fall together: and the Commander in Chief earnestly
recommends a continuance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A54" id="Page_A54">[Pg A54]</a></span>
confirmation of this order to his successors in command, as a measure of
justice, dictated by honour and humanity.</p>

<p>The Commander in Chief hopes that this explicit order and declaration,
giving such ample security to the royalists on his part, will ease their
minds; and, confidence being restored, that it will produce a becoming
zeal and exertion to unite for the public interest heart and hand, in
contributing to good order and tranquillity; and that he may expect
there will not be any further emigration on the bare report of an
enemy's approach, or even on being actually landed; as every
apprehension of danger must be dispelled when all are heartily united
for the common safety and defence.</p>

<p>The Commander in Chief, hoping therefore for this effect and conduct
from the people in general, does in a more particular manner recommend
to persons of consequence to set a laudable example of fortitude on
every occasion, and to assemble and embody under proper leaders, to act
in conjunction with his majesty's regular troops, for the protection of
their honour, families, and fortunes, which must be dearer to them than
life.</p>

James's at ten o'clock, and marched before his Majesty, who was pleased

<p>I was informed by Captain Shank of the royal navy, the agent for
transports, that during the expedition 46 masters of transports, and
1100 of their men, died of the yellow fever. The returns of the masters
were given in, of the men a rough calculation to the above amount was
made. On board the Broderic transport the fever raged with such
violence, that the mate, the only survivor, was obliged to scull his
boat on shore to fetch off negroes to throw the dead overboard, and
himself died soon after.</p>

<p>Of the royal navy the loss was considerable; but it has not been in my
power to procure a list of the officers who died or were killed on this

On our arrival we found several of the ships that had parted company on
the voyage; and each day after brought more of them, till the whole were
collected.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
I have given an exact representation of one of these boats in the view
of the town and bay of St. Pierre.</p></div>

An idea was started of raising four hundred white men in the island of
Barbadoes to augment the army; but there was not time to arm and
discipline them; therefore it was dropped. However, a certain number of
negroes were provided to attend the army, four hundred of whom were sent
from Dominica for that service; some more were brought from St.
Vincent's; and the council of Barbadoes made an offer of supplying a
large number of them to serve on very liberal terms; but when the matter
came to be investigated, the terms were found to be far from equitable,
and therefore were rejected.&mdash;Mr. Baillie and Mr. Monro, two
planters of Grenada, were here introduced to the Commanders in Chief,
and were received on board the Boyne as guests, and treated with the
greatest hospitality; they proceeded with us on the expedition. Mr.
Gibbs, one of the council of Barbadoes, also accompanied us.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
During the landing of our troops, Lieutenant Bowen, who was in a
gun-boat, perceived a number of the enemy collecting in the woods near
the shore, and being scarce noticed by them, was suffered to approach
without molestation, and having loaded his gun with langrege, he dealt
such destruction among them, that they fled in all directions. A shot
from the battery, which stuck in the larboard bow of the Boyne, when cut
out, proved to be a thirty-four pounder, and to have been heated, but
not sufficiently to do any mischief by fire.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
The Generous Friends transport, laden with officers' baggage, &amp;c.
dragged her anchor on the night of the 5th, struck against a rock at the
entrance of the bay, and was wrecked. Fortunately, however, the hands on
board and the baggage were saved.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
The French have since said that they fired on the boat because it had a
white flag hoisted: this was a most ridiculous objection; for, though
with them a mark of aristocracy, it has ever been acknowledged by all
nations as a signal of peace and cessation from hostilities. However, we
found it necessary afterwards to comply with their wishes; and whenever
a boat was sent from either party on a truce, they carried the flag of
the opposite party in the bow of the boat, and their own colours abaft.</p></div>

They met with considerable opposition in this business; and the boats
employed in landing the troops by some mistake got close under the
enemy's batteries, before they discovered their situation. Our loss
however was less than might have been expected. The Dromedary, venturing
too near the battery of Point Negro, received a shot between wind and
water, entering under the counter, and a second shot went through the
quarter-deck barricade, killed one man, and wounded four, among whom was
Captain Tatham.</p></div>

About this time the army had nearly experienced an irreparable loss. As
General Dundas was writing in his tent, a notorious villain, of the name
of Barbarose, presented himself at the door of the tent, demanding to
speak with the General, who, to drive him away, called to the centinel
to "bayonet the fellow;" on which, in his fright, he dropped a dagger
well oiled; and on being seized, proved to have been the assassin of a
French royalist.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a>
On our first arrival at the island of Martinique, the Commanders in
Chief dispatched Captain Mason (aid de camp to the General) bearing a
flag of truce, with a summons to the town of St. Pierre. Au Cane, the
mayor, met him on the quay on horseback, attended by a numerous body of
armed men, with a field piece; &amp;c. and instead of reading the letter
and summons, dismissed him rudely with threats.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a>
Information having arrived that some of the enemy had retired from St.
Pierre to a five-gun battery on that part of the island, Major
Manningham was dispatched with a strong detachment in flat-boats, under
the protection of the Zebra sloop of war, and was completely successful
in driving them from thence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a>
According to the best account I could collect, ten killed and forty-four
wounded.&mdash;I must here beg the reader will pardon the inaccuracy of
my account of the killed and wounded in this and the other actions that
took place. Though I have made every possible inquiry, I have not been
able to meet with the regular returns, which must have been given in to
the adjutant general's office at Martinique.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a>
The two six-pounders were to strengthen the post that commanded the road
to Fort Royal by Dillon's house.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a>
One day, when the Commander in Chief met them on the road, they (being
ignorant that a battery was appointed for them to serve in) surrounded
the General, and offered him their services, swearing they thought it
d&mdash;&mdash;d hard to have all work and no fighting; and hoped his
Honour would let them have some share in it. The General, with that
kindness which won the hearts of all that had the happiness to serve
under him, said, "Well, my lads, you shall have a battery to
yourselves." On which, having saluted him with three hearty cheers, the
honest fellows went readily to their work again.</p></div>

As it was my lot to be much in the society of this excellent young man,
having from the time we arrived in the West Indies enjoyed his
friendship, and on several occasions accompanied him on service,
afterwards attending him from the camp at Point Negro to the hospital at
St. Pierre, and remaining with him at intervals till the time of his
death: these circumstances will, I trust, plead my excuse for detaining
the reader from more important events of the campaign while I pay the
tribute of respect to the memory of my gallant but ill-fated friend. Mr.
James Miln was a native of Arbroath in Scotland, and after serving for
near thirteen years with credit in the navy, was promoted to a
lieutenancy on board the Blanche frigate by Admiral Sir John Laforey,
and was afterwards taken on board the Boyne as fifth lieutenant by Sir
John Jervis on his arrival at Barbadoes. His general good conduct as a
man and officer soon attracted the notice of the naval Commander in
Chief (than whom no man is more quick sighted to discern merit, and
happy to reward it). By him no doubt he would have been much employed on
the most active service, had not that melancholy event taken place,
which deprived the service of a good and brave officer, and left me only
the sad task of deploring, while I commemorate the death of a friend,
from the excellency of whose heart and understanding I was in hopes of
reaping future entertainment and improvement.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a>
Since writing of this, news has arrived from the West Indies of the
capture of a ship belonging to Victor Hughes (the present republican
tyrant of Guadaloupe) loaded with wealth amassed by this plunderer to
the amount of half a million sterling. Such has been the general conduct
of the French Commanders, while ours have been vilified for claiming
even the legal bounty for their suffering and exhausted followers.</p></div>

The gallant defence made by General Rochambeau and his garrison was
strongly manifested on our entering Fort Bourbon, as there was scarce an
inch of ground untouched by our shot or shells; and it is but justice to
say, it did them the highest honour.&mdash;Among the casualties that
happened during the siege, the following deserves notice. A party of the
besieged were in one of the chambers of the Bomb-proof in the Traverse,
when a shell from one of our batteries fell into the arched way, and
rebounding, burst the door of the chamber, and killed the whole party.</p></div>

It is much to the credit of the officers, who served on shore from the
landing on the island till the reduction of Fort Bourbon, a period of
forty-seven days, that they shared the same hardships as the privates
without a murmur, sleeping in their clothes the whole time; and being so
situated that they seldom could have the benefit of tents or any kind of
hovel, they were exposed continually to the heavy rains and nocturnal
damps which in a tropical climate so severely try the constitution; but,
owing (as it was imagined) to the flannel shirts which were invariably
worn by all ranks, they, as yet, suffered less from sickness than could
have been expected.</p></div>

The conduct and abilities of Colonel Coote in this enterprise gained him
the particular thanks of the Commander in Chief, whose orders he had so
ably executed; and he was well supported by the whole of his department,
particularly by Major Evatt, Captains Buchanan, Crosbie, Welch, Thomas
Grey (one of the General's aid de camps), and Stovin; also by Major of
Brigade Vischer, with Lieutenant Drozier, and the detachment of royal
artillery, who spiked the guns.</p></div>

The garrison that marched out with General Ricard, and laid down their
arms as prisoners of war, were about three hundred men, troops of the
line (among which one hundred and twenty-five were of the regiment
d'Aunai), some artillery, and a few people of colour. General Ricard, at
his own request, was sent to America, as had been General Rochambeau,
who chose that place in preference to his own distracted country, where
the system of blood that was then the order of the day under the tyranny
of Robespierre, would have immolated even these men, who had with so
much bravery defended the posts intrusted to them by their country.</p></div>

Fortuné, earnestly recommending them to be finished, as it was a very

The revenue department was however an exception to this arrangement of

carry on that necessary branch. Those places therefore in the district
of the island of Martinique, which were immediately necessary to be
filled, were attended to, and a list of them sent home, that when his
majesty's pleasure should be made known with regard to the future civil
government, they might be put in motion without any delay.</p></div>

As this is an office, I believe, hitherto unknown in the navy, I shall
explain the reason of its being now established. The Admiral had in a
former war experienced the attention and zeal of Mr. Weir, and being
well acquainted with the fatigue and danger that would unavoidably be
the lot of his surgeon, if he did his duty, he pitched upon him for that
office, and as an encouragement he procured permission to appoint a
surgeon general to the navy, and his appointment did honour to his
discernment. Mr. Weir was indefatigable in attending the wounded and
sick in his own ship, and equally ready to visit others; and even where
his duty had no demand on him, his humanity led him to give his advice
and assistance. In his mode of treatment of that dreadful disease, the
yellow fever, he was more successful than was generally the case, as the
Boyne lost a less proportion of patients under that afflicting malady
than any other ship on the expedition.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a>
Lieutenant George Vaughan of the Boyne was this day promoted to the
command of the Zebra sloop, and the Chaplain of the Boyne was appointed
to the chaplaincy of the garrison of Guadaloupe, there being no other
chaplain on the expedition; but government at home did not think fit to
confirm the appointment. Lieutenant Davers of the Boyne was promoted to
be acting commander of the Inspector, from whence he was promoted to the
command of the Bull Dog sloop. Lieutenant Ogle was also appointed acting
commander of the Assurance.</p></div>

After the islands were captured, a small reinforcement arrived, which
was to be retained by Sir Charles Grey, if he thought fit; but as he
knew it was much wanted to carry on the war at St. Domingo, and as it
was insufficient to enable him to undertake an expedition against
Cayenne, which he at first intended, he sent it on to Jamaica, under the
command of Brigadier General Whyte; and Lieutenant Colonel Lennox, who
came out soon after, he dispatched thither also.</p></div>

During the time that Fort Bourbon was besieging we sent a summons to the
town of St. Pierre, which was rejected with an uncommon degree of
insolence, and Captain Mason (the General's aid de camp, who went with
the flag of truce) was insulted. About a fortnight afterwards the place
was taken by storm, without any capitulation, consequently subject to
plunder by the custom of war; but so far from any irregularity being
suffered, a drummer was hanged by order of General Dundas for attempting
it; and such exact discipline and quiet behaviour was maintained among
the troops, that the shops were opened the day after the capture. From
the time of the refusal of the summons to the final capture, the
republicans continued to load all the property and produce on board
vessels under American colours, which they did constantly, in order to
deprive the captors of their just rights, in case the place should be
taken.&mdash;Interested American merchants were continually endeavouring
to wrest the hard-earned prize money from the army and navy, while they
were supplying the enemy with provisions and other necessaries.</p></div>

He was interred on the 4th of June, with all military honours, on one of
the highest batteries in Fort Matilda, which, from that circumstance,
was called Dundas's battery, and a stone with a suitable inscription was
placed over his remains. The command of the forces, and the government
of Guadaloupe, now devolved on Lieutenant Colonel Blundell of the
forty-fourth regiment.</p></div>

Their success appears to have been greatly accelerated by the treachery
or cowardice of several French royalists then in the fort, who offered
their services to sally on the besiegers. Accordingly they marched out;
but, on approaching the enemy, they were panic struck and fled, and few
of them returned to Fleur d'Epée. The British merchants and sailors from
the town of Point à Pitre had thrown themselves into this fort to assist
the garrison, which was greatly reduced by sickness and death. This
little band, under command of Lieutenant Colonel Drummond of the
forty-third regiment, did all that gallant men could do; twice they
repulsed the assailants; but at length, overpowered by numbers, and the
royalists having demanded that the gates should be thrown open, and the
enemy now pouring in from all sides, the few remaining troops were
obliged to make the best retreat they could to Point à Pitre, which, not
being tenable after the loss of Fleur d'Epée, was abandoned by them, and
they crossed over to Basse Terre. In this affair, besides the loss of
many others, Captain Suckling of the artillery was wounded at his gun by
a bayonet, and left behind at Point à Pitre.&mdash;There were in
Guadaloupe when taken by the French a larger proportion of troops than
in either of the other conquered islands.</p></div>

On the 18th of June, Lieutenant Colonels Coote and Cradock arrived from
St. Christopher's, where they had been detained by the yellow fever,
which they had caught on board a transport in which they were proceeding
to England on leave of absence, and though not recovered from the
baneful effects of that disease, they now came forward to offer their
services to the Commanders in Chief, which were accepted in a manner
highly honourable to both parties.</p></div>

In the afternoon one hundred and eighty seamen from the Boyne, Commanded
by Lieutenants Wolley, Thomson, and Maitland, landed under the Salines
to windward of Grozier, and took post on the heights near that place;
other parties of seamen also were landed at Grozier, forming altogether
a strong reinforcement for the army.</p></div>

In this business Lieutenant Wolley had some narrow escapes. The
commanding officer of the fort rushed out of the guard-room on the
alarm, with a lighted match in his hand. He first fired an amuzet,
luckily pointed in an opposite direction; he then three times attempted
to fire a twenty-four pounder as Mr. Wolley and his men were advancing
to the muzzle of it; but fortunately, either from the dampness of the
powder, or trepidation of the man, it missed taking effect; on which he
flung down his match, and retreated to the further end of the fort,
whither Mr. Wolley followed; but, from the darkness of the night, he
soon lost sight of him. As he returned he was met by his own men, who,
taking him for an enemy, were about to put him to death, when his voice
discovered their mistake. Had the cannon in the first instance gone off,
it must have made considerable havock among our men, as it was loaded
with a bag of musket balls.&mdash;This day Captain Armstrong of the 8th
regiment, was killed by a cannon ball at the landing-place at Grozier,
while giving directions to a serjeant about some ordnance which was to
be landed there. He was on horseback, and had just remarked, that there
could be no danger from the fire at Fleur d'Epée at that place; a shot,
however, from the fort dipped over the point of land which seemed to
shelter the landing-place, and cut him asunder. He has often been heard
to say that he thought that a man must be truly unfortunate who fell by
a single cannon ball.</p></div>

In this affair Captain Morrison of the 58th regiment was killed by a
musket ball through his head as he was leading his men on to the attack;
he fell regretted by all who knew him, being an accomplished, amiable,
and brave man: I too felt severely on this occasion, having enjoyed much
of his society and friendship. The Commander in Chief, who knew his
worth, paid the tribute of applause to his memory; and the Admiral, when
he heard of his fall, exclaimed, "He has left few equals behind him."</p></div>

A young officer, formerly of Walsh's regiment, took this opportunity of
escaping to us. His name was Clarke, his family of Martinique, where his
father was a counsellor at law. He had been imprisoned three months at
Bourdeaux, on his endeavouring to avoid joining the armies on the
frontiers, and was released to embark on this expedition, as the only
chance of rejoining his friends. He reported, that one Fremont, a daring
fellow, who, though not first in command, had great influence, was
killed this morning on the walls of Fleur d'Epée, by a musket-ball from
one of our people. The enemy lost in this action upwards of three
hundred men. On the 29th, the Commander in Chief sustained a heavy loss
in the death of Captain Newton Ogle, of the 70th regiment, one of his
excellency's aid-de-camps; he was a young man of an excellent
understanding, and had distinguished himself on all occasions where his
exertions had been called forth.</p></div>

Captain Burnet of the 43d regiment, who had led his company of
grenadiers into the town, was blown up at the time Captain Robertson was
killed. His clothes being on fire, were pulled off by his brother
officers. His face and hands were rendered entirely black by the
explosion. In this situation he first received a musket-ball which broke
his arm, and was then met by his own grenadiers, who, taking him for one
of the French blacks, attacked him with charged bayonets, and wounded
him in three places before he could make himself known to them. The
instant they discovered their mistake they expressed the utmost horror
and contrition, and brought off this excellent officer in their arms;
who, I am happy to be enabled to add, survived, notwithstanding the
dreadful situation he was in. Lieutenant Conway of the 60th regiment,
was also blown up, and in that condition continued to lead on his men
and encourage them, till unfortunately he fell by a musket-ball through
his body.</p></div>

officers, forty-three serjeants, and six hundred and eleven privates.</p>

<p>I must here beg leave to add an extract from Admiral Sir J. Jervis's
public letters to the Lords of the Admiralty on this subject. "The fate
of Captain Lewis Robertson, who had distinguished himself highly, fills
my mind with the deepest regret; he had long been a child of misfortune,
although he possessed talents to merit every success and prosperity;
and, as I am informed, has left a widow and infant family unprovided
for. I beg leave to recommend them to the protection and good offices of
their lordships, to obtain a suitable provision, which will be a great
encouragement to officers in similar circumstances, to emulate so great
an example."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The celebrated Brigadier General Arnold, being on business of a
mercantile nature at Point à Pitre, was captured at the time the place
fell into the hands of the republicans, and, being apprehensive of ill
treatment, changed his name to Anderson. He was put on board a
prison-ship in the harbour, and had considerable property in cash with
him, of which, it is supposed, Fremont and Victor Hughes were informed,
as he received an intimation from one of the French sentries, that he
was known, and would soon be guillotined. On this alarming intelligence
he determined to attempt an escape, which he effected in the following
masterly manner. At night he lowered into the sea a cask containing
clothes and valuables, with a direction on it, that if it floated to the
shore of our camp at Berville, it might be known, and restored to him;
he then lowered down his cloak bag to a small raft which he had
prepared, on which also he got himself, and proceeded to a small canoe,
in which he pushed for the British fleet, directed by the Admiral's
lights. On his making towards the mouth of the harbour he was challenged
by the French row guard, but by the darkness of the night escaped from
them, and arrived on board the Boyne by four o'clock on Monday morning,
the 30th of June.</p>

<p>During the whole time of this latter campaign the fever, which had been
so destructive the preceding year, continued to rage in our army and
navy with unabated violence. General Grey lost all the servants he
brought from England by it, including two who had lived with him for
many years. It first broke out with violence when the former campaign
ended.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_61_61" id="Footnote_61_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61_61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a>
Among the many causes of uneasiness that now bore hard upon the
Commanders in Chief (by the failure of their well-concerted plans, the
dreadful mortality among their troops, and the despair of reinforcements
arriving from Europe) the misconduct of one high in estimation as an
officer, and hitherto looked upon as a man of strict integrity, was not
the least galling. The case was this: At the taking of St. Lucia,
Colonel Sir Charles Gordon, who had repeatedly distinguished himself by
his gallant conduct, was appointed governor of that island, and in the
last promotion was advanced to the rank of brigadier general; soon after
which some very unpleasant reports prevailed, of extortions and
peculations by him, and taking bribes of the inhabitants, who were
supposed to be disaffected, in order to suffer them to remain on the
island, and then breaking his word with them. At length a regular
complaint was laid before the Commander in Chief, who instantly ordered
a court martial to be summoned, and sent an officer to St. Lucia to
arrest Sir Charles Gordon, and convey him to Martinique, in order for
trial. At this time the fever raged so violently that the two first
courts-martial that met on this business, were dissolved by the death of
a majority of the members. At length, in order to prevent the like
accident from again interrupting the course of justice, the General
appointed a greater number of officers than usual to attend, and the
trial proceeded; the event of which was, that the prisoner was found
guilty of the crimes laid to his charge, and was sentenced to refund the
money he had extorted, and to be rendered incapable of serving his
majesty again: but, in consequence of some favourable circumstances that
came out on the trial, he was allowed to sell his commission. See
Appendix, pages 42, 43, 48.</p></div>

In one of these attacks Monsieur Vermont was shot through the body, his
lieutenant, Monsieur De Lisle, was shot through his breast, and another
of his officers killed; in this situation he beat off the enemy. This
gallant, but unfortunate officer, was, at the beginning of the
revolution, possessed of a good estate near Trois Riviere on Basse
Terre, which soon made him an object of republican vengeance; his house
was attacked, but he escaped into the woods, supposing that his amiable
wife would be safe from their fury, being far advanced in her pregnancy;
but the monsters, not regarding her situation, put her to death with
circumstances of barbarity too dreadful to relate, and such as would
fill, I trust, every Briton's breast with the utmost horror; his aged
mother too, and beautiful sister, shared the same fate. He was taken and
thrown into prison at Fort Matilda, to reserve him for a public
spectacle on the guillotine, when we arrived, and released him from
thence by the capture of the island.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_66_66" id="Footnote_66_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a>
Their conduct prior to, and since the enemy had attacked the camp,
deserved a far better fate: finding themselves excluded from terms of
capitulation, they wished permission to cut their way through the
enemy's army, by which a few of them, at least, might escape, and the
rest meet an honourable death; but this request, it is said, was
refused; perhaps it was believed that on their capture the enemy would
relent, and not put their sanguinary threats into execution. Two of
these unfortunate men hastened to the shore, in hopes of getting on
board the covered boat; but being disappointed, and aware of the fate
that awaited them, they instantly shot themselves on the beach. On
hearing of this melancholy business, General Grey published an order
that did equal honour to his feelings and his mind. See Appendix, page
53.</p></div>

General Prescott had so small a force in that quarter, that he could not
possibly afford any material assistance to General Graham; but he had
made an effort by sending a detachment from the 35th regiment to support
some royalists at St. Marié, which however proved ineffectual; and the
numbers at Martinique being now too small for the defence of it, General
Grey was unable to afford any assistance from thence; however he ordered
the flank companies of the 4th battalion, of the 60th regiment from St.
Vincent's, and part of the 21st from St. Christopher's, to reinforce
Brigadier General Graham. Fortunately, however, they arrived too late,
as their numbers were inadequate to save it, and they afterwards made
part of the garrison at Fort Matilda.</p></div>

This gentleman, after having enjoyed a lucrative post, was unwilling to
lose the fruits of it, and, instead of rendering any assistance to
General Prescott, he took French leave, not forgetting to carry with him
a chest well lined, in order to render his residence at Antigua
comfortable.</p></div>

The republican officer who came with him informed us that he saw the
execution of the unfortunate royalists, and that twenty-seven heads were
struck off in seven minutes and a half!</p></div>

On the 19th of October the Admiral sent Lieutenant Skynner with a party
of seamen to a battery at the N. W. end of the town, from whence he
brought off some cannon and mortars.</p></div>

On the 2d of November, Captain Miller was promoted to the command of the
Vanguard, Captain Sawyer being removed to the Assurance, vice Captain
Bryer, deceased; and Lieutenant Launcelot Skynner of the Boyne, was
appointed commander of the Experiment, vice Captain Miller.</p></div>

Fort Matilda, formerly Fort Charles, was at first a battery only,
erected to command the road; afterwards it was enclosed as a depot for
arms and ammunition in case of insurrection among the slaves; and during
the last war the French added to its outworks, which were now totally in
ruins, but served the enemy, particularly those on the opposite side of
the Galion river, as trenches, and effectually covered their musketry
that commanded the principal works of the besieged: in short, the fort
was completely commanded on the three sides by land, so that not a man
in it could move without being seen by the enemy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_74_74" id="Footnote_74_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a>
During the siege a cannon ball took off the fore part of the General's
hat. He coolly observed, "that a miss was as good as a mile!"</p></div>

So much having been said of this man, it may be agreeable to the reader
to be informed of his origin, and pursuits in the former part of his
life.&mdash;Victor Hughes was originally a petty inn-keeper at Basse
Terre, Guadaloupe; from whence he was driven for some misdemeanor, and
became master of a small trading vessel at St. Domingo; then a
lieutenant in the French navy; and afterwards a deputy in the national
assembly: from whence he came out to the West Indies as commissioner,
with controlling powers over the commanders of the army and navy. His
abilities were certainly good, his courage and perseverance undoubted;
but, from the ferocity of his character, he was both feared and hated.
Colonel Drummond, who with his small party was taken at Point Bacchus,
relates that the republicans put to death all the sick they found in the
hospital at Petit Bourg, many of the women, and some children, cutting
off heads, and otherwise mutilating the bodies; that, as the men who
surrendered with him at Point Bacchus, fainted in their march, they were
instantly bayonetted; the Colonel himself was, by particular directions
from Victor Hughes, ordered to clean the prison ship in turn with the
others; but from this disgrace he was relieved by the dutiful attachment
of his men, who would not permit it: his food and lodging were the same
as the rest, no attention being paid to his rank; but from the respect
and good behaviour of his men, not one of whom would desert from him. A
great number of people of all ages, sexes, and conditions, were
condemned to the guillotine by this inexorable tyrant, all of whom were
conducted in boats round the prison ship, in order to distress and
intimidate the British prisoners.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
